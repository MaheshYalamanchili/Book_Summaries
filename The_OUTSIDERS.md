# CEOs have five essential choices for deploying capital
* investing in existing operations
* acquiring other businesses
* issuing dividends
* paying down debt
* repurchasing stock

# Three alternatives for raising capital
* tapping internal cash flow
* issuing debt
* raising equity

# The Outsider CEOs
## Tom Murphy at Capital Cities Broadcasting
* There are two basic types of resources that any CEO needs to allocate: financial and human.
* unconventional approach, one that emphasized flat organizations and dehydrated corporate staffs
* extraordinary autonomy for operating managers
* Decentralization is the cornerstone of our philosophy. Our goal is to hire the best people we can and give them the responsibility and authority they need to perform their jobs. All decisions are made at the local level.
* environment that selected for and promoted independent, entrepreneurial general managers.
* Frugality was also central to the ethos.

## Singleton at teledyne 
* eschewed detailed strategic plans, preferring instead to retain flexibility and keep options open.
* like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into the future.
* designed organizations that allowed them to focus on capital allocation, not operations
* focused their investments in industries they knew well, and were comfortable with concentrated portfolios of public securities
* Neither offered quarterly guidance to analysts or attended conferences, provided informative annual reports with detailed business unit information.
* highly decentralized organizations with very few employees at corporate and few, if any, intervening layers between operating companies and top management.

## Bill Anders at General Dynamics
* circumstances vary, and it’s how you play the hand you’re dealt that ultimately determines your success as an executive
* what do you do with a high-priced stock? Use it to acquire a premium asset in a related field at a lower multiple and benefit from the arbitrage
* spending meaningfully less money on capital expenditures and paying lower dividends than his peers while devoting substantial resources to acquisitions and sporadic stock repurchases.

## John Malone at TCI
* There is an apparent inverse correlation between the construction of elaborate new headquarters buildings and investor returns.

## Bill Stiritz at Ralston Purina
* The hurdle we always used for investment decisions was the share repurchase return
* divesting noncore assets, repurchasing shares, and acquiring businesses complementary to their core product lines.

## Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway
* The outsider CEOs were generally ruthless in closing or selling businesses with poor future prospects and concentrating their capital on business units whose returns met their internal targets
* two primary characteristics: a high degree of concentration and extremely long holding periods.

# The Outsider's Mind-Set
* the value of financial projections was determined by the quality of the assumptions, not by the number of pages in the presentation
* repurchases were not made to prop up stock prices or to offset option grants (two popular rationales for buybacks today) but rather because they offered attractive returns as investments in their own right.
* Armed with their return calculations, all (with the notable exception of John Malone, who was constantly buying cable companies in pursuit of scale) were willing to wait long periods of time (in the case of Dick Smith at General Cinema, an entire decade) for the right opportunity to emerge.
* these CEOs faced the inherent uncertainty of the business world with a patient, rational, pragmatic opportunism, not a detailed set of strategic plans
* You have to be willing to always ask what the return is and to go forward only with projects that offer attractive returns using conservative assumptions.
* In today’s world of social media, instant messaging, and cacophonous cable shows, it’s increasingly hard to cut through the noise, to step back and engage Kahneman’s system 2

# The Outsider's Checklist:

1. The allocation process should be CEO led, not delegated to finance or business development personnel.
2. Start by determining the hurdle rate—the minimum acceptable return for investment projects (one of the most important decisions any CEO makes).
  	Comment: Hurdle rates should be determined in reference to the set of opportunities available to the company, and 	should generally exceed the blended cost of equity and debt capital (usually in the midteens or higher).
3. Calculate returns for all internal and external investment alternatives, and rank them by return and risk (calculations do not need to be perfectly precise). Use conservative assumptions.
	  Comment: Projects with higher risk (such as acquisitions) should require higher returns. Be very wary of the adjective strategic—it is often corporate code for low returns.
4. Calculate the return for stock repurchases. Require that acquisition returns meaningfully exceed this benchmark.
    Comment: While stock buybacks were a significant source of value creation for these outsider CEOs, they are not a panacea. Repurchases can also destroy value if they are made at exorbitant prices.
5. Focus on after-tax returns, and run all transactions by tax counsel.
6. Determine acceptable, conservative cash and debt levels, and run the company to stay within them.
7. Consider a decentralized organizational model. (What is the ratio of people at corporate headquarters to total employees—how does this compare to your peer group?)
8. Retain capital in the business only if you have confidence you can generate returns over time that are above your hurdle rate.
9. If you do not have potential high-return investment projects, consider paying a dividend. Be aware, however, that dividend decisions can be hard to reverse and that dividends can be tax inefficient.
10. When prices are extremely high, it’s OK to consider selling businesses or stock. It’s also OK to close under-performing business units if they are no longer capable of generating acceptable returns.
