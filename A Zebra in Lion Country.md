## A zebra in lion country
* When a large segment of the market gets overpriced and eventually corrects, everybody gets nailed. No matter that you've scorned the high-flyer, crazy-multiple stocks; your sensible portfolio, too, will go down. Your only consolation is that you probably won't be as mauled and that your stock are likely to recover rapidly, because former faviorates are now every body's avoid list.
* Look for stocks that have basic value but are out of fashion.
* It is so much more comfortable to play it safe and be in inside zebra, but if you want to stand out from the pack, you have to stand outside the pack.

## Think Small
* At big companies you talk to executives, in small companies you talk to owners.
* The managers of small companies are generally better at responding to changes. They have aggresive spirit that is needed 
* Payoff in the small companies:
  1. Growth: stock price will go up in line with EPS, dividend and book value growth.
  2. Acquisition: company can get acquired by large company.
  3. Repurchase: if share price do not increase, company can buy back its shares.
  4. Revaluation: as company grows institutional investors will flock, the ugly duckling pronounced a swan.

* Taking precautions: Small is good, micro is not. For little companies it's like auditioning for a chorus line: one misstep and you're out.
Look for a company that has carved out a special niche for itself.

* Criterion 
  1. Seasoned rather than nearly new
  2. Financial strength 
  3. Dominance in market segment 
  4. Understandibility

* Diversify in large cap & MF, since small cap goes through cycle of investors favour. Health of the market (index) is very different from patient on the next bed(small cap stock).
Due to liquidity problems in small cap, buy stock of company you will believe you will hold on for long term.

## Growth, Value or GARP
* Don't be in a mould of growth or value, be Growth at Reasonable Price investor
* Earnings disappointment are rough on growth stock, upside is more in case of earnings surprise.

## Theme and Variations
* The greatest investment profit came when an ugly duckling becames a swan
* The fact that the stock has already moved up sharply doesn't mean that it can't still have plenty of room left to climb.
* If a company is performing, let it's stock too continue to perform.
* Look for rational and sound companies when industry gets bombed, research will turn up some legitimate bargains and all it takes is patience.
* Find what you know and what you dont know. The further you stray away from what you know, the more likely that you are gambling and not investing.

* Develop your own set of convictions/guidelines, write down on paper and that will give you confidence to take action in tough markets.
* What is my attitude towards risk, and probably that is not changed since you are 12? (Volatile, romantic, emotional or steady, trustworthy and down to earth).
* First I determine themes that will be played out over next several years. Then I identify groups of stocks that reflect those themes.
* Do I ever by a atosck even if no theme is evident? Sure. But only if the company has monopoly or near monopoly on some market niche.
* I concentrate on areas that will benefit from strong economic, social or technological trends. And I want trend that will last for four years or longer.
* The growth of middle class in developing countries is very simple but powerful way to think about future.
* If you can see where connmen are flocking, you can tell which groups are about to peak.

## Downstream from technology
* Going downstream, investing in business that will benefit from technology, rather than technology companies themselves is often a smart strategy.
* The best company in marginal industry is better than the third best company in a major industry.
* A dull business run by a good businessman is far better than glamorous business run by mediocre management.
* Boring stocks sells at discount. Buy enough of them and you can cover loss in high tech.
* Have a reason for for buying every stock you own. As soon as that reason comes into doubt, ask yourself if it isn't time for a change.
* Predicting market fuitile excercise instead try studying individual stocks.

## Lessons in bear market
* Bear market is great time to load up stocks. I don't believe in timing market but believe in buying cheap.
* A flat market doesn't mean you can't find stock that goes up.
* In bleak period falling stock prices is not a problem it's part of solution.
