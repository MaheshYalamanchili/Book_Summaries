### Coffee-Can Portfolio
* The essence of the coffee-can idea is really that it’s a way to protect you against yourself—from the emotions and volatility that make you buy or sell at the wrong times. Bullishness or bearishness doesn’t enter into it.

### STUDIES OF 100-BAGGERS
* The essence lies in the alchemy of five elements forming the acronym SQGLP,” they wrote: 
	* S—Size is small. 
	* Q—Quality is high for both business and management. 
	* G—Growth in earnings is high. 
	* L—Longevity in both Q and G 
	* P—Price is favorable for good returns.

### THE 100-BAGGERS OF THE LAST 50 YEARS
* You need it in both the size of the business and in the multiple the market puts on the stock, as we’ve seen—the twin engines, as I call them.

* It is a myth that to get a 100-bagger you have to start with tiny companies.

* You have to train your mind to look for ideas that could be big, to think about the size of a company now versus what it could be.

* You have to train your mind to look for ideas that could be big, to think about the size of a company now versus what it could be. This doesn’t mean you have to have a huge market to address, although that helps. Even a small company can become a 100-bagger by dominating a niche.

### THE KEY TO 100-BAGGERS
* “If you have a company with tons of cash flow but top-line [sales] growth is 5% or less, the stock doesn’t go anywhere,” he said. “IBM is a good example. Good ROE. Cheap. But the absence of top-line growth means the decline in share count has been offset by multiple contraction.” As a result, the stock goes nowhere.

* It’s important to have a company that can reinvest its profits at a high rate (20 percent or better). ROE is a good starting point and decent proxy.

### OWNER-OPERATORS: SKIN IN THE GAME
* If management and the board have no meaningful stake in the company—at least 10 to 20% of the stock—throw away the proxy and look elsewhere.

* People with their own wealth at risk make better decisions as a group than those who are hired guns. The end result is that shareholders do better with these owner-operated firms.

### BET BIG
* I can’t be involved in 50 or 75 things. That’s a Noah’s Ark way of investing—you end up with a zoo that way. I like to put meaningful amounts of money in a few things.

### STOCK BUYBACKS
* There is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares:
	* the company has available funds - cash plus sensible borrowing capacity - beyond the near-term needs of the business and, 
	* finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively calculated.

* When you find a company that drives its shares outstanding lower over time and seems to have a knack for buying at good prices, you should take a deeper look.

### KEEP COMPETITORS OUT
* Great management by itself is not a moat, a point Dorsey makes as well. You have surely heard the quip from Warren Buffett that “when management with the reputation for brilliance meets a company with a reputation for bad economics, it’s the reputation of the company that remains intact.”

* *Industry is not destiny* - Even the best industries include companies that destroy value and the worst industries have companies that create value. 

* “high gross margins are the most important single factor of long run performance. The resilience of gross margins pegs companies to a level of performance. Scale and track record also stand out as useful indicators.”

	* “Amazon’s are pretty mediocre,” Berry pointed out in an email to me, “but it is clear that the value added is in the selection and the convenience, not in the good itself (which could be found anywhere). But if you can’t see how or where a company adds value for customers in its business model, then you can be pretty sure that it won’t be a 100-bagger. Unless it strikes oil!”

* If gross margins are sticky and persistent, then a good turnaround candidate would be one with a high gross profit margin and a low operating margin. The latter is easier to fix than the former.

* It is great to have a moat, but true moats are rare and not so easy to identify all the time. Therefore, you should look for clear signs of moats in a business—if it’s not clear, you probably are talking yourself into it— you may also want to find evidence of that moat in a firm’s financial statements. Specifically, the higher the gross margin relative to the competition, the better.

### MISCELLANEOUS
#### Don’t Chase Returns
* Don’t chase returns! And don’t measure yourself against the S&P 500 or any other benchmark. Just focus on trying to buy right and hold on.

#### Don’t Get Bored
* If you can find ways to fight boredom and not take it out on your portfolio, your returns will benefit. Just keep your eye on the prize: hundredfold returns are not boring.

#### Avoid Scams
* *On Management:* Read several quarters concalls at a time to look for disappearing initiatives, changes in language.

#### Ignore Forecasters
* Extreme predictions are rarely right, but they’re the ones that make you the big money.”
* Instead of playing the guessing game, focus on the opportunities in front of you. And there are always, in all markets, many opportunities. Yes, always!
* The best ideas are often the simplest.

#### 100-Bagger Miscellany
* When we invest abroad we often trade risks we see for risks we can’t see or are not aware of.
* Note that inflation was bad for both. But it was less bad for See’s, which owned little in tangible assets.
* Asset-heavy businesses generally earn low rates of return—rates that often barely provide enough capital to fund the inflationary needs

### IN CASE OF THE NEXT GREAT DEPRESSION
* Three types of stock unlikely to participate to any extent in any price comeback.
	* The first category includes stocks that were grossly overpriced to begin with.
	* The second type of stock unlikely to recover is one that suffers a “permanent impairment.”
	* The third and final category includes stocks “subject to massive dilution during the meltdown where old common stockholders were unable to protect themselves from the dilution.”

### 100-BAGGERS DISTILLED: ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
* Akre’s approach is simple and easy to understand. He calls it his threelegged stool. He looks for
	* businesses that have historically compounded value per share at very high rates;
	* highly skilled managers who have a history of treating shareholders as though they are partners;
	* businesses that can reinvest their free cash flow in a manner that continues to earn above-average returns.

* The most important principle is the one identified above. It’s so important it’s worth repeating again: you need a business with a high return on capital with the ability to reinvest and earn that high return on capital for years and years.
* Focus on growth in sales and earnings per share.
* You don’t want to pay stupid
* You don’t want to pay stupid prices.
* We should prefer a company that can reinvest all of its earnings at a high clip. If it pays a dividend, that’s less capital that it has to reinvest. And that reduces the rate of return.
* Emphasize looking for high returns on capital and the ability to reinvest and produce high returns for years and years. A moat, even a narrow moat, is a necessity.
* The law of large numbers starts to work against you at some point.
* Having a great owner-operator also adds to your conviction.
* It’s preferred, but not required. There are also businesses for which
* Companies do outlive and outrun their founders and owner-operators.
* Find some way to leave your stocks alone. Let them ripen on the vines. Don’t pick them too early.
* Just because a stock market index, such as the S&P 500, is pricey doesn’t mean you should give up on stocks. Unless you are a buyer of the index itself, it is not relevant to the business of finding great stocks today.
* You need a really good filter.
* Just as in life, so in the pursuit of 100-baggers. Good luck helps.
* If you’ve done the job right and bought a stock only after careful study, then you should be a reluctant seller.
