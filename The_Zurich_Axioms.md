# The First Major Axiom: On Risk
## Worry is not a sickness but a sign of health. If you are not worried, you are not risking enough.
It says put your money at risk. Don’t be afraid of getting hurt a little. The degree of risk you will usually be dealing with is not hair-raisingly high. By being willing to face it, you give yourself the only realistic chance you have of rising above the great unrich.
The price you pay for this glorious chance is a state of worry. But this worry, the First Axiom insists, is not the sickness modern psychology believes it to be. It is the hot and tart sauce of life. Once you get used to it, you enjoy it.
This is **inverse of Buddhist philosophy** of the less you own, the less you will have to worry about.

### Minor Axiom I: Always play for meaningful stakes
* If you bet $100 and double your-money, you’re still poor.
### Minor Axiom II: Resist the allure of diversification
* Major flaws in Diversification:
  1. It forces you to violate the precept of Minor Axiom I – that you should always play for meaningful stakes.
  2. By diversifying, you create a situation in which gains and losses are likely to cancel each other out. Leaving you exactly where you began - at Point Zero
  3. By diversifying, you become a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air all at once.

# The Second Major Axiom: On Greed
## Always take your profit too soon.
* Greed, in the context of the Second Axiom, means excessive acquisitiveness: wanting more, more, always more. It means wanting more than you came in for or more than you have a right to expect. It means losing control of your desire.
* Don’t stretch your luck. Expect winning streaks to be short. When you reach a previously decided-upon ending position, cash out and walk away.
* And when you’ve sold, don’t torment yourself if the winning set continues without you. In all likelihood it won’t continue long.

### Minor Axiom III: Decide in advance what gain you want from a venture, and when you get it, get out
* One excellent way to reinforce the ‘ending’ feeling is to rig up some kind of reward for yourself. A medal, if you will.

# The Third Major Axiom: On Hope
## When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray. Jump.
* Dont wait around when trouble shows itself. Get away from it promptly. Don't hope, don't pray. Hope and prayer are nice, no doubt, but they are not useful as tools of a speculative operation.
* Ask yourself whether the developing problem is likely to get fixed. Look for trustworthy and tangible evidence that improvement is on the way, and if you see none, take action without further delay. Calmly and deliberately before everybody else has started to panic, jump off the ship and save yourself.

#### Obstacle while jumping:
1. The fear of regret of a loser will turn into a winner after you’ve gone away. But that is seldom a wise course where your money is concerned.
2. The need to abandon part of an investment. This is inordinately painful to some. To console you, however, I can tell you that it gets less painful with practice.
3. The third obstacle to the Third Axiom’s implementation is the difficulty of admitting you were wrong. - you should explore yourself and seek ways to handle it.

### Minor Axiom IV: Accept small losses cheerfully as a fact of life. Expect to experience several while awaiting a large gain.
* Ideally we should welcome our small losses, since they protect us from large losses.

# The Fourth Major Axiom: On Forecasts
## Human behavior cannot be predicted. Distrust anyone who claims to know the future, however dimly.
* It is of the utmost importance that you never take economists, market advisers, or other financial oracles seriously.
* It is easy to get dazzled by a successful prophet, especially in the world of money.
* Forecasts of physical events (weather, tide tables, sun rise) can be trusted, but the stock market (colossal engine of human emotion) can not be predicted.

# The Fifth Major Axiom: On Patterns
## Chaos is not dangerous until it begins to look orderly.
* Don't see order where order does not exist, but study the speculative medium and take best shot and remember it is still a chance even though you have studied it.

### Minor Axiom V: Beware the Historian’s Trap
* Wrong believe that the orderly repetition of history allows for accurate forecasting in certain situations.
### Minor Axiom VI: Beware the Chartist’s Illusion
* Making charts of stock prices is like making charts of ocean froth. You’ll see each pattern once, and then it will be gone.
### Minor Axiom VII: Beware the Correlation and Causality Delusions
* Even the most rational minds perceives links of cause and effect where none exist. When we have to, we invent them, since we are order-seeking humans.
### Minor Axiom VIII: Beware the Gambler’s Fallacy
* The incorrect belief that, if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa), when it has otherwise been established that the probability of such events does not depend on what has happened in the past.

# The Sixth Major Axiom: On Mobility
## Avoid putting down roots. They impede motion.
* Dont get stuck into being surrounded by the old, the familiar, and the comfortable
* You must stay footloose, ready to jump away from trouble or seize opportunities quickly.

### Minor Axiom IX: Do not become trapped in a souring venture because of sentiments like loyalty and nostalgia
* It is a mistake to let yourself get too attached to any physical thing in which your capital is invested. Get attached to people, but not to houses or neighborhoods.

### Minor Axiom X: Never hesitate to abandon a venture if something more attractive comes into view
* Getting attached to things decreases your mobility, the capacity to move fast when the need arises.

# The Seventh Major Axiom: On Intuition
## A hunch can be trusted if it can be explained.
* Trust a hunch only if you can explain it.
* Put your hunch to the test, to improve the odds in your favor.
* No matter how good a hunch feels, don’t let it lull you into a state of overconfidence. Stay worried.

### Minor Axiom XI: Never confuse a hunch with a hope
* Examine hunch with extra care and double one's guard in case of trouble

# The Eighth Major Axiom: On Religion and the Occult
## It is unlikely that God’s plan for the universe includes making you rich.
* God may do much for you, but one thing He plainly isn’t concerned about is the size of your bank account.
* Money and the supernatural are an explosive mixture that can blow up in your face. Keep the two worlds apart.

### Minor Axiom XII: If astrology worked, all astrologers would be rich
* Every occult practitioner can come up with at least one good story about a lucky hit. But hold tight to your skepticism and your money.

### Minor Axiom XIII: A superstition need not be exorcised. It can be enjoyed, provided it is kept in its place.

# The Ninth Major Axiom: On Optimism and Pessimism
## Optimism means expecting the best, but confidence means knowing how you will handle the worst. Never make a move if you are merely optimistic.
* Never make a move if you are merely optimistic. Before committing your money to a venture, ask how you will save yourself if things go wrong. Once you have that clearly worked out, you’ve got something better than optimism. You’ve got confidence.

# The Tenth Major Axiom: On Consensus
## Disregard the majority opinion. It is probably wrong.
### Minor Axiom XIV: Never follow speculative fads. Often, the best time to buy something is when nobody else wants it.
* Majority pressure can not only dislodge a good hunch; it can even make us doubt ourselves when we know we’re right, since arguing with a majority is enormously hard.
* Best defense against majority pressure is the simple awareness of its existence and coercive power.
* This dosent mean blindly do what majority isn't dong, it means resist majority pressure and study situation yourself.
