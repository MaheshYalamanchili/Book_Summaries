# The First Major Axiom: On Risk
## Worry is not a sickness but a sign of health. If you are not worried, you are not risking enough.
It says put your money at risk. Don’t be afraid of getting hurt a little. The degree of risk you will usually be dealing with is not hair-raisingly high. By being willing to face it, you give yourself the only realistic chance you have of rising above the great unrich.
The price you pay for this glorious chance is a state of worry. But this worry, the First Axiom insists, is not the sickness modern psychology believes it to be. It is the hot and tart sauce of life. Once you get used to it, you enjoy it.
This is **inverse of Buddhist philosophy** of the less you own, the less you will have to worry about.

### Minor Axiom I: Always play for meaningful stakes
* If you bet $100 and double your-money, you’re still poor.
### Minor Axiom II: Resist the allure of diversification
* Major flaws in Diversification:
  1. It forces you to violate the precept of Minor Axiom I – that you should always play for meaningful stakes.
  2. By diversifying, you create a situation in which gains and losses are likely to cancel each other out. Leaving you exactly where you began - at Point Zero
  3. By diversifying, you become a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air all at once.
