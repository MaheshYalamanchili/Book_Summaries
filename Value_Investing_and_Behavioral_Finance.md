### Success and Failure
* ﻿Sow a thought and you reap an act, sow an act and you reap a habit, sow a habit and you reap a character, sow a character and you reap a destiny.
* The human race is made up of people you and I who are basically lazy, greedy, ambitious, selfish, ignorant and vain. All of them are striving for the same things: security, comfort, leisure, love, respect and fulfillment.
But the key point is basic law of human nature is that people always tend to seek the fastest and the easiest way to get the things they want. Even if the long term consequences of the actions will be under-achievement and failure.

### Market Oscillates between Greed and Fear
* Being aware and keeping one’s emotions under control and at the same time understanding others’ behavioral anomalies enables a wise investor to identify bargains.
* Real discipline and courage is: you buy when you emotionally do not feel like buying, and sell when your heart says no but the mind and the logic say yes.
* Equanimity in times of market noise will help one to be a successful investor.

### Behavioral Obstacles to Value Investing
* Intelligence and brilliance carries the day, but it is the wisdom that endures.
* Investors are always looking at something new, as they believe that novelty can fetch them more money.
* What works in market is:
  * One’s ability to understand one’s emotional and psychological weaknesses. 
  * Understanding the irrational behavior of others and benefiting from their mistakes.
  * To have the courage and conviction to stand away from the crowd.

### Growth Traps
* It is an invention of analysts and investment bankers to sell expensive stocks to investors as growth stocks. Ultimately, when one buys a stock for investment one has to look at the following: 
  * Quality of the management
  * Sustainability of the business
  * Good cash flow to enable dividend payments
  * Reasonable return on investment
  * Right valuations.
* The first two are qualitative and would depend upon individual judgment. However, the other three are quantitative and quite easy to calculate.
* Investment opportunities don’t come daily. However the noise of the markets offer mispriced securities from time to time.

### Commodity Investing 
* Valuation Parameters:
  * Market Leadership
  * Low-Cost Producer
  * Earnings Per Share
  * Level of Debt
* In the stock markets, a small percentage of people end up being successful in the long run, whereas the majority of people, in spite of being successful in the short run, end up losers in the long run. People tend to focus more on the outcome than on the process. This is so evident in commodity stocks.
* In commodity, market leader, a well-run efficient company under good management, fall short of returns to investors as compared to its inefficient peers due to:
  * Low-Base Effect
  * High Debt Companies
  * Debt Reduction
  * Losses Carried Forward Resulting in Lower Taxes
  * Re-rating
* Contrary to the general impression on Wall Street, the stocks of high-cost producers are more logical commitments than those of low-cost producers when the buyer is convinced that a rise in the price of a commodity is imminent and he wishes to exploit this conviction to the utmost.
* The rules in commodity stocks are very different from the conventional, common-sensical approach. Returns to investors from such companies lag way behind the returns from inefficient and debt-ridden companies, especially during an upward inflection point.

### Sector Bubbles
* Fundamentals in a sector do not change as fast as they would change in a company. Therefore, a rapid increase in the weight of a sector is a sure sign of a bubble
* On the other hand, a gradual increase in the weight of sector over time, due to a steady rise in profits of firms is not a sign of a bubble. Such a rise does not exhibit increased investor expectations.

### Index Investing
* Index investing is in no way better than active investing.

### IPO
* It is safe to conclude that IPOs, which seem like a good investment vehicle are, in reality, not so. In fact an IPO is a product which is against investor interest, as it is mostly offered to investors

### Bubble Traps
* Envy is the worst sin in the stock markets. Because you really do not know the facts.
* Economic growth is time-testing and the benefits accrue over a period of time. However, the stock markets are known for extrapolating too much into the future. They discount the future too fast.

### Lessons for Investors
* Valuations do Matter the Most
* Avoid Triple Digit PEs
* When the leaders go on becoming expensive, it is very easy to rig the mid- and small-cap stocks. Due to their lack of liquidity, their rise becomes fast and they become operator favorites.
* Avoid Large Little-known Companies In a bubble phase, little-known companies tend to become large due to the market capitalization going up because of the price increase.
* Beware of information asymmetry.
* This Time it is Different
* Every bubble phase has a new theme; however, the excesses are the same.
* There are certain universal principles that do not change, irrespective of other changes: A company has to make a profit to reward its shareholders, to earn returns one has to buy at the right price, valuations matter the most, there are no short-cuts, and you cannot sow today and reap tomorrow.
* Cash is the king. Opportunities always come, but when they come you need to have the cash. This cash can come when you follow the basic tenets of investing: buy low and sell high. There are a lot of foolish people around who will give you such opportunities. So never get married to your stocks.
* Avoid short-selling temptation, as a bubble can last longer than one imagines.
* It is best to watch the “fun” end and then buy your stocks at good valuations.
* Stock markets behave irrationally and give weight not to what is important, but to what is more popular and current.
* Money is good as long it is in the pocket. It becomes dangerous when it goes in the head. That is when we become irrational and start making blunders.
* When an investor makes money, he should reason his success by appreciating any unforeseen event, which led him to make money out of a trade and, accordingly, weigh his strengths against his weaknesses, rather than blindly attributing all the success to himself.
