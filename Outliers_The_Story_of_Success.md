# Outliers: The Story of Success - Malcolm Gladwell

## Matthew Effect

- Canadian hockey players are the majority born in the first 3 months of the year
- Since the first trips they have a small advantage of several months that at the age of 7 is enough to make the difference.
- Then, with time, they participate in more intense training and overtake those who do not catch the "lot".

## The 10,000-Hour Rule

- As a musician, the only thing that decides how far you will reach is the number of hours you dedicate to the training.
- Bill Joy, he invented Java, was lucky to have access to a computer since 1971.
- The Beatles had 8 hours a day concerts in Hamburg bars before they became stars.
- Bill Gates came out of the room through the window at night to go to the nearest PC to university at night.
- Most oil billionaires were born between 1830 and 1840, and most programmer billionaires in the 1950s and 1960s.


## The genius problem

- IQ does not define success in life
- IQ> 120 is irrelevant
- A group of "termites" (children intellectually endowed) has been studied since childhood until they became adults. They behaved like any normal group of people, not being exceptional.
- Children from wealthy families learn early to ask more, to do.
- Power is in their hands, not in other adults

## Joe Flom

- The Jew arrived in States, who finished at Harvard and found no job in normal lawyers' homes
- But large law firms at the time were "upside down" and did not participate in litigation because most were hostile takeovers.
- But then in 1970 began the takeover process, and Joe Flom and his law firm had the biggest experience in "dirty games."
- It is best to be born at the time of depression, because there are few children and more places (less competition).
- The textile industry
- Jews were not allowed to have land, so they specialized in commerce.
- In 1930, Borgenicht started selling 40 aprons of children, and in 3 years it had 20 employees.
- In textiles, even if you were badly paid in any trade, you were closer to the center of California and you could see what the successful people are doing.
