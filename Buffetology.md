## Work through following questions:
1. Does the company have any identifiable consumer monopolies or brand-name products, or do they sell a commodity-type product?
2. Do you understand how it works? This is, yes, another of those cases that you, the consumer/investor, have intimate knowledge of, and experience with using the product.
3. Is the company conservatively financed? D/E Ratio. If not debt free can it pay outstanding debt easily
4. Are the earnings of the company strong and do they show an upward trend?
5. Management allocates capital only to those businesses within its realm of expertise
6. Management utilizes capital to increase shareholder value when it is possible. e.g. buy backs
7. The way management has spent the retained earnings of the company appears to have increased the per share earnings and, therefore, shareholders’ value.
   > Total EPS of last 10 years/Retained earnings for last 10 years > 15%
8. Above average ROE > 15%
9. Is the company free to adjust prices to inflation? e.g. FMCG companies able to increse price & pass inflation to customer
10. Do operations require large capital expenditures to constantly update the company’s plant and equipment?

## Valuations:
1. Initial Rate of Return and Relative Value to Government Bonds
   * EPS/Government bonds interest rate = Buying Price of Stock
   * EPS/Buying Price = Initial Rate of return which you are getting
2. Stock As an Equity/Bond
   * If company maintains ROE of 15% for next 10 years and retains 60% each year, then equity PS grows at 9% (15%*60%), calculate Equity PS after 10 years (FV) = Current Equity PS(1+9%)^10
   * Calculate EPS after 10 years = Equity PS FV * ROE at 10th year(Gustimates)
   * Apply Highest and Lowest historical PE to EPS and get stock price range after 10th year
3. Project an Annual Compounding Rate of Return Using the Historical Annual Per Share Earnings Growth Figure
   * Estimate EPS growth rate, and calculate, 10th year EPS
   * Apply Highest and Lowest historical PE to EPS and get stock price range after 10th year
