* There can be no innovation if you operate out of fear of the new.
* *The relentless pursuit of perfection* - It's not about perfectionism at all costs. It's about creating an environment in which people refuse to accept mediocrity.
* In work, in life, you'll be more respected and trusted by the people around you if you own up to your mistakes. It's impossible to avoid them; but it is possible to acknowledge them, learn from them, and set an example that it's okay to get things wrong sometimes.
* Treat everyone with fairness and empathy. This doesn't mean that you lower your expectations or convey the message that mistakes don't matter. It means that you create an environment where people know you'll hear them out.
* Strive for perfection but always be aware of the pitfalls of caring only about the product and never the people.
* True integrity - Trust your own instincts and treat people with respect.
* Ask the questions you need to ask, admit without apology what you don't understand, and do the work to learn what you need to learn as quickly as you can.
* Don't start negatively, and don't start small. People will often focus on little details as a way of masking a lack of any clear, coherent, big thoughts. If you start petty, you seem petty.
* Don't let ambition get ahead of opportunity. It's important to know how to find the balanceâ€”do the job you have well; be patient; look for opportunities to pitch in and expand and grow.
* Don't invest in small projects that would sap my and the company's resources and not give much back.
* You have to be self-aware enough that you don't cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job.
* It's hard to look at your current models, sometimes even ones that are profitable in the moment, and make a decision to undermine them in order to face the change that's coming.
* You can't communicate pessimism to the people around you. It's ruinous to morale. No one wants to follow a pessimist.
* Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion.
* Optimism emerges from faith in yourself and in the people who work for you. It's not about saying things are good when they're not, and it's not about conveying some blind faith that "things will work out." It's about believing in your and others' abilities.
* People sometimes shy away from big swings because they build a case against trying something before they even step up to the plate. Long shots aren't usually as long as they seem. With enough thoughtfulness and commitment, the boldest ideas can be executed.
* You have to convey your priorities clearly and repeatedly. If you don't articulate your priorities clearly, then the people around you don't know what their own should be. Time and energy and capital get wasted.
* It's easy to be optimistic when everyone is telling you you're great. It's much harder, and much more necessary, when your sense of yourself is on the line.
* Treating others with respect is an undervalued currency when it comes to negotiating. A little respect goes a long way, and the absence of it can be very costly.
* If something doesn't feel right to you, it won't be right for you.
* what people think of you is what they'll think of your company.
* If you're in the business of making something, be in the business of making something great.
* You have to approach your work and life with a sense of genuine humility.
* Hold on to your awareness of yourself, even as the world tells you how important and powerful you are. The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look at yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you've lost your way.
