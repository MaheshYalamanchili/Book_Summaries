To get really, really big, to reach the kind of stratospheric success, people need to have something on the inside, something that's genuine.

It's just not goal that will make successful.Trying to be successful with making money as your goal is like trying to travel a superhighway at seventy miles an hour with your eyes glued to the rearview mirror.

All the great fortunes in the world have been created by men and women who had a greater passion for what they were giving—their **product, service or idea** — than for what they were getting. And many of those great fortunes have been squandered by others who had a greater passion for what they were getting then what they were giving.

Givers always attract because they love to give that's why they're attractive.

The world treats you more or less the way you expect to be treated

What you focus most on is what you get, 'Go looking for trouble and that's what you'll find'. Go looking for conflict, and you'll find it. Go looking for people to take advantage of you, and they generally will.
- See the world as a dog-eat-dog place, and you'll always find a bigger dog looking at you as if you're his next meal.
- Go looking for the best in people, and you'll be amazed at how much talent, ingenuity, empathy and good will you'll find.

## 5 LAWS OF STRATOSPHERIC SUCCESS
1. THE LAW OF VALUE
2. THE LAW OF COMPENSATION
3. THE LAW OF INFLUENCE
4. THE LAW OF AUTHENTICITY
5. THE LAW OF RECEPTIVITY

### 1. THE LAW OF VALUE
If we take an example of any business, say a Restaurant
one way to determine a restaurant being Bad, Good and Great is
  - A Bad Restaurant tries to give just enough food and service, both in Quantity AND Quality, to justify the money it takes from the Customer.
  - A Good Restaurant strives to give Most Quantity AND Quality for the money it takes.
  - A Great Restaurant Strives to defy imagination!Its goal is to provide a Higher Quality of food and service than any amount of money one could possible pay for.

But you might be wondering that if we keep on Giving Giving Giving then how are we making money? Does it Makes money? Its Great question. It's just a BAD first Question. The first Question Should be "Does it Serves? Does it add value to others?" if the Answer to that question is yes, then go ahead and ask 'Does it make money'?
The reason you give give give is because you love to. Its not a strategy, its a way of life and when you do "then very very profitable things begin to happen".
So the Law first law is

> *"Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment."*

### 2. THE LAW OF COMPENSATION
Your compensation is directly proportional to how many lives you touch.
The Law is

> *"Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them."*

Firstly, it means that you get to determine your level of compensation—it"s under your control. If you want more success, find a way to serve more people. It's that simple.

It also means there are no limitations on what you can earn, because you can always find more people to serve. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, 'Everybody can be great because anybody can serve.' Another way to say that might be, 'Everybody can be successful because anybody can give. What you Focus on is what you get.'

### 3. THE LAW OF INFLUENCE
In any business, we need to know how to develop network, By network I don't necessarily mean customers or clients. A network of people who know you, like you and trust you.They might never buy a thing from you, but they've always got you in the backs of their minds. They're people who are personally invested in seeing you succeed, y'see? And of course, that's because you're the same way about them. They're your army of personal walking ambassadors.

When we have our own army of personal walking ambassadors, referrals keep coming our way faster than we can handle them. Always remember people will do business with and refer business to those people they know, like and trust, but never keep a score, That's not networking-thats poker.

Always watch out for the other guy. Watch out for his interests. Watch his back. Forget about fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty's a losing proposition. The only winning proposition is one hundred percent. Make your win about the other person, go after what he wants. Forget win-win—focus on the other person's win. Here it is. The Third Law, The Law of Influence is

> *"Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first."*

If you place the other person's interests first, your interests will always be taken care of. Always. Some people call it enlightened self-interest. Watch out for what other people need, with the faith that when you do, you'll get what you need. Money, Position, history of outstanding accomplishments never creates Influence, in-fact influence creates them. Putting other people's interests first creates influence.

### 4. THE LAW OF AUTHENTICITY
What's the foundation of all people skills? Liking people? Caring about people? Being a good listener? Those are all helpful, but they're not the core of it. The core of it is who you are. It starts with you. Always remember no matter what your training, no matter what your skills, no matter what area you're in, you are your most important commodity, the most valuable gift you have to offer is you.

The most valuable thing you have to give people is yourself. No matter what you think you're selling, what you're really offering is you. So the Fourth Law, the law of Authenticity is 

> *"The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself."*

### 5. THE LAW OF RECEPTIVITY
Every giving can happen only because it is also a receiving. IF you give and then try to stop the receiving that comes back, you're like King Canute watching the tide roll out of commanding it not to come back in. It has to come back in, just as your heart has to contract after relaxing.

At this instant, all over the globe, all of humanity is breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide. So is the rest of the animal kingdom. And right now, at this instant, all over the globe, the billions and billions of organisms of the plant kingdom are doing the exact opposite—they're breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Their giving is our receiving, and our giving is their receiving. In fact, every giving can happen only because it is also a receiving.

Trying not to receive is not only foolish, it's arrogant. When someone gives you a gift, what gives you the right to refuse it—to deny their right to give? Receiving is the natural result of giving.
All the giving in the world won't bring success, won't create the results you want, unless you also make yourself willing and able to receive in like measure. Because if you don't let yourself receive, you're refusing the gifts of others—and you shut down the flow.
So the fifth and the last law is

> *"The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving."*
