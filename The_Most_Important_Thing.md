## 10. The Most Important Thing Is … Combating Negative Influences
> The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure 
thing—these factors are near universal. Thus they have a profound collective impact on most investors and most markets. 
This is especially true at the market extremes. The result is mistakes—frequent, widespread, recurring, expensive mistakes.

#### Many people possess the intellect needed to analyze data, but far fewer are able to look more deeply into things and withstand the powerful influence of psychology.

1. **Greed** - The desire for gain is one of the most important elements in the workings of the market and the overall economy. The danger comes when it moves on further to **greed**
2. **Fear** - Fear, is more like panic. Fear is overdone concern that prevents investors from taking constructive action when they should.
3. **Tendency to dismiss logic, history and time-honored norms** - 
    > Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true. -Demosthenes

    The belief that some fundamental limiter is no longer valid—and thus historic notions of fair value no longer matter—is invariably at the core of every bubble and consequent crash.

    Investors are always looking for the holy grail, the free lunch or a ticket to riches without risk. Few people question whether it can exist or why it should be available to them.
    At the bottom line, hope springs eternal. But the silver bullet doesn't exist. No strategy can produce high rates of return without risk.
    And nobody has all the answers; we're all just human. Markets are highly dynamic, and, among other things, they function over time to take away the opportunity for unusual profits.
    Unskeptical belief that the silver bullet is at hand eventually leads to capital punishment.
4. **Tendency to conform to the view of the herd rather than resist** - even when the herd's view is clearly cockeyed.
5. **Envy** - People who might be perfectly happy with their lot in isolation become miserable when they see others do better.
    In the world of investing, most people find it terribly hard to sit by and watch while others make more money than they do.
    A lot of the drive in investing is competitive. High returns can be unsatisfying if others do better, while low returns are
    often enough if others do worse. The tendency to compare results is one of the most invidious.
6. **Ego** - The best returns bring the greatest ego rewards. When things go right, it's fun to feel smart and have others agree.
    Thoughtful investors avoid sharing in the riskiest behavior because they're so aware of how much they don't know and because they have their egos in check.

> Believe me, it's hard to resist buying at the top (and harder still to sell) when everyone else is buying, the pundits are positive, 
the rationale is widely accepted, prices are soaring and the biggest risk takers are reporting huge returns. It's also hard to resist 
selling (and very tough to buy) when the opposite is true at the bottom and holding or buying appears to entail the risk of total loss.

### Weapons to marshal on your side to increase your odds
* A strongly held sense of intrinsic value,
> JOEL GREENBLATT: Without this, an investor has no home base. A strong sense of intrinsic value is the only way to withstand the psychological influences that affect behavior. Those who can’t value companies or securities have no business investing and limited prospects (other than luck) for investing successfully. This sounds simple, but plenty of investors lack it.
* Insistence on acting as you should when price diverges from value,
* Enough conversance with past cycles - gained at first from reading and talking to veteran investors, and later through experience—to know that market excesses are ultimately punished, not rewarded,
* A thorough understanding of the insidious effect of psychology on the investing process at market extremes,
* A promise to remember that when things seem “too good to be true,” they usually are,
* Willingness to look wrong while the market goes from misvalued to more misvalued (as it invariably will), and
* Like-minded friends and colleagues from whom to gain support (and for you to support).
 
These things aren't sure to do the job, but they can give you a fighting chance.
## 16. Appreciating the Role of Luck
- Don't be tempted when others succeed widely with something unknown to you
- In very long term, focus on earnings. There is good chance of getting PE expansion as icing on the cake 🍰. [More](https://www.tankrich.com/luck-vs-skills/)
- Be honest about your success & failures.
- Learn to decide which outcome came because of luck and which becasue of skills
- Skills should be judged over large number of trials
- Cautious and suboptimizing approach may produce average results in short runs, but superior investors will be able to produce above average results over long run.
- Take action based on thinking of **future events in terms of a probability distribution** instead of single future that is knowable
- Its easy to misunderstand

## 18. Avoiding Pitfalls
    
### Pitfalls can be caused by

1. Analytical/Intellectual error
    1. Too little information
    2. Incorrect information
    3. Wrong analytical process
    4. *Failure of imagination* 
        - Unable to conceive full range of possible outcomes or unable to understand consequences of more extreme occurance
        
        > The assumption that something can't happen has the potential to make it happen, since people who believe it can't happen will engage in risky behaviour and thus alter the environment
        > 
        - In black swan event, failure of imagination in first instance is not **anticipating possible extreme outcome**, and in second instance is **not understanding consequences of that extreme outcome**.
2. Physiological/Emotional error
    1. Greed and fear
    2. Willingness to suspend disbelief and scepticism
    3. Ego and envy
    4. Drive to pursue high returns through risk bearing
    5. Overrate once knowledge
3. Failure to recognise market manias and move in opposite direction
    1. Too much capital availability, makes money flow to wrong place
    2. When capital goes where it shouldn't, bad things happen
    3. When capital is in oversupply, investors compete for low returns and thin margin for error
    4. Widespread disregard of risk create great risk
    5. Inadequate due diligence leads to investment loss
    6. Capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fails test of time
    7. Hidden fault lines in portfolio, can make price of unrelated assets to move in tandem
    8. Physiological and technical factors can swap fundamentals
    9. Market change, invalidating models
    10. Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn't add value
    11. Excess correct

> When there is nothing perticularly cleaver to do, potential pitfall lies in insisting on being cleaver

## 19. Adding Value

![https://forum.valuepickr.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b0bb39ad5db095420b400918a97ced8f8af9669c.jpg](https://forum.valuepickr.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b0bb39ad5db095420b400918a97ced8f8af9669c.jpg)

- Without skills agressive investor moves a lot in boh directions and defensive investor moves little in either direction
- But **performance of investors who adds value is asymetrical, they capture more % of market gain than market losses**.
- Everything is double edged sword in investing with exception of superior skills (good investment process)
## 20. Reasonable Expectations
- If someone offers a sure-to-be-right view of future, as Is it too good to be true?, Why he is telling me this?
- The bottom can only be identified in retrospect.

<aside>
💡 The perfect is enemy of good. e.g. buying only in bottom can cause you to miss a lot
</aside>

- Unresonable expectations will always get you in trouble through greater risk than perceived.
