## CAN SLIM Framework
1. C = Current Big or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per Share
   * Quarterly EPS should be up a major percentage– 25% to 50% at a minimum
3. A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth
   * Significant earnings growth in each of the last three years plus strong recent quarterly improvements. Don’t accept anything less.
4. N = Newer Companies, New Products, New Management, New Highs off Properly Formed Bases
   * Companies with new products or services, or that have benefited from new management or materially improved industry conditions. Then buy their stocks when they are emerging from sound, correctly analyzed price consolidation patterns and are close to, or actually making, new price highs on increased volume.
5. S = Supply and Demand: Big Volume Demand at Key Points
   * Companies that are buying back their stock in the open market and that show considerable stock ownership by management are preferred.
6. L = Leader or Laggard: Which Is Your Stock?
   * Look for, and confine your purchases to, market leaders
7. I = Institutional Sponsorship
   * Stocks with at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters
8. M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It
   * Do not buy breakout in bear markets
   * Never fight the market—it’s bigger than you are.
