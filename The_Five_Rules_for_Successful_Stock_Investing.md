### The Five Rules:
1. Do your homework: Know the business inside and out 
    * Reading the annual report cover to cover
    * Checking out industry competitors
    * Going through past financial statements
2. Find [economic moats](#economic-moat).
3. Have a margin of safety:

   Include a margin of safety into the price you’re willing to pay for a stock. The size of your margin of safety should be larger for shakier firms with uncertain futures and smaller for solid firms with reasonably predictable earnings.

4. Hold for the long haul.
5. Know when to sell.
    * Did You Make a Mistake?
    * Have the Fundamentals Deteriorated?
    * Has the Stock Risen Too Far above Its Intrinsic Value?
    * Is There Something Better You Can Do with the Money?
    * Do You Have Too Much Money in One Stock?

### The seven mistakes to avoid:
1. Swinging for the fences: Loading up your portfolio with risky, all-or-nothing stocks.
2. Believing that it’s different this time
3. Falling in love with products: Geat products do not necessarily translate into great profits.
4. Panicking when the market is down: Think for yourself and seek out bargains in parts of the market that everyone else has forsaken,rather than buying the flavor of the month in the financial press.
5. Trying to time the market: There is no strategy that consistently tells you when to be in the market and when to be out of it, and anyone who says otherwise usually has a market-timing service to sell you.
6. Ignoring valuation
7. Relying on earnings for the whole story: At the end of the day, cash flow is what matters (see [Accrual Accounting](#accrual-accounting)), not earnings. For a host of reasons, accounting-based earnings per share can be made to say just about whatever a company’s management wants them to, but cash flow is much harder to fiddle with.

## [Economic Moat](#economic-moat)
### To analyze a company’s economic moat, follow these four steps:
1. Evaluate the firm’s historical profitability. Has the firm been able to generate a solid return on its assets (ROA) and on shareholders’ equity (ROE) ? This is the true litmus test of whether a firm has built an economic moat around itself.
2. If the firm has solid returns on capital and consistent profitability, assess the sources of the firm’s profits. Why is the company able to keep competitors at bay? What keeps competitors from stealing its profits?
3. Estimate how long a firm will be able to hold off competitors, which is the company’s competitive advantage period. Some firms can fend off competitors for just a few years, and some firms may be able to do it for decades.
4. Analyze the industry’s competitive structure. How do firms in this industry compete with one another? Is it an attractive industry with many profitable firms or a hypercompetitive one in which participants struggle just to stay afloat?

### Five ways that an individual firm can build sustainable competitive advantage:
1. Creating real product differentiation through superior technology or features
2. Creating perceived product differentiation through a trusted brand or reputation
3. Driving costs down and offering a similar product or service at a lower price
4. Locking in customers by creating high switching costs
5. Locking out competitors by creating high barriers to entry or high barriers to success:
    * The most obvious way to lock out competitors is to acquire some kind of regulatory exclusivity.
    * A much more durable strategy for locking out competitors is to take advantage of the network effect.

### Think about an economic moat in two dimensions. 
* **Depth** - How much money the firm can make
* **Width** - How long the firm can sustain above-average profits.

e.g. Technology firms often have very deep but very narrow moats because technology moves fast
Estimating how long a moat will last is tough stuff, but you need to at least give it some thought, even if you can’t come up with a precise answer. Just being able to separate firms into three buckets—a few years, several years, and many years—is very useful.

### [Accrual accounting](#accrual-accounting)
e.g. Colgate sells a few cases of toothpaste to Joe’s Corner Store for $1,000 on February 15 but gives Joe 60 days to pay because he’s a regular customer and has a good track record of paying his bills on time. March 31 rolls around, Joe hasn’t paid yet, and Colgate closes its books for the quarter. Colgate shows $1,000 in sales on its income statement because it shipped the toothpaste to Joe—according to the income statement, the sale is complete, regardless of whether Colgate has received payment. But because Joe hasn’t ponied up the grand yet, Colgate will post an entry on its balance sheet to show that Joe owes Colgate $1,000. The entry goes into the accounts receivable line. As you can see, a company can show rip-roaring sales growth without receiving a cent of cash, which is why we need a statement of cash flows.
