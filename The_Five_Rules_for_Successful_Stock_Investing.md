### The Five Rules:
1. Do your homework: Know the business inside and out 
    * Reading the annual report cover to cover
    * Checking out industry competitors
    * Going through past financial statements
2. Find [economic moats](#economic-moat).
3. Have a margin of safety:

   Include a margin of safety into the price you’re willing to pay for a stock. The size of your margin of safety should be larger for shakier firms with uncertain futures and smaller for solid firms with reasonably predictable earnings.

4. Hold for the long haul.
5. Know when to sell.
    * Did You Make a Mistake?
    * Have the Fundamentals Deteriorated?
    * Has the Stock Risen Too Far above Its Intrinsic Value?
    * Is There Something Better You Can Do with the Money?
    * Do You Have Too Much Money in One Stock?

### The seven mistakes to avoid:
1. Swinging for the fences: Loading up your portfolio with risky, all-or-nothing stocks.
2. Believing that it’s different this time
3. Falling in love with products: Geat products do not necessarily translate into great profits.
4. Panicking when the market is down: Think for yourself and seek out bargains in parts of the market that everyone else has forsaken,rather than buying the flavor of the month in the financial press.
5. Trying to time the market: There is no strategy that consistently tells you when to be in the market and when to be out of it, and anyone who says otherwise usually has a market-timing service to sell you.
6. Ignoring valuation
7. Relying on earnings for the whole story: At the end of the day, cash flow is what matters (see [Accrual Accounting](#accrual-accounting)), not earnings. For a host of reasons, accounting-based earnings per share can be made to say just about whatever a company’s management wants them to, but cash flow is much harder to fiddle with.

## [Economic Moat](#economic-moat)
### To analyze a company’s economic moat, follow these four steps:
1. Evaluate the firm’s historical profitability. Has the firm been able to generate a solid return on its assets (ROA) and on shareholders’ equity (ROE) ? This is the true litmus test of whether a firm has built an economic moat around itself.
2. If the firm has solid returns on capital and consistent profitability, assess the sources of the firm’s profits. Why is the company able to keep competitors at bay? What keeps competitors from stealing its profits?
3. Estimate how long a firm will be able to hold off competitors, which is the company’s competitive advantage period. Some firms can fend off competitors for just a few years, and some firms may be able to do it for decades.
4. Analyze the industry’s competitive structure. How do firms in this industry compete with one another? Is it an attractive industry with many profitable firms or a hypercompetitive one in which participants struggle just to stay afloat?

### Five ways that an individual firm can build sustainable competitive advantage:
1. Creating real product differentiation through superior technology or features
2. Creating perceived product differentiation through a trusted brand or reputation
3. Driving costs down and offering a similar product or service at a lower price
4. Locking in customers by creating high switching costs
5. Locking out competitors by creating high barriers to entry or high barriers to success:
    * The most obvious way to lock out competitors is to acquire some kind of regulatory exclusivity.
    * A much more durable strategy for locking out competitors is to take advantage of the network effect.

### Think about an economic moat in two dimensions. 
* **Depth** - How much money the firm can make
* **Width** - How long the firm can sustain above-average profits.

e.g. Technology firms often have very deep but very narrow moats because technology moves fast
Estimating how long a moat will last is tough stuff, but you need to at least give it some thought, even if you can’t come up with a precise answer. Just being able to separate firms into three buckets—a few years, several years, and many years—is very useful.

### [Accrual accounting](#accrual-accounting)
e.g. Colgate sells a few cases of toothpaste to Joe’s Corner Store for $1,000 on February 15 but gives Joe 60 days to pay because he’s a regular customer and has a good track record of paying his bills on time. March 31 rolls around, Joe hasn’t paid yet, and Colgate closes its books for the quarter. Colgate shows $1,000 in sales on its income statement because it shipped the toothpaste to Joe—according to the income statement, the sale is complete, regardless of whether Colgate has received payment. But because Joe hasn’t ponied up the grand yet, Colgate will post an entry on its balance sheet to show that Joe owes Colgate $1,000. The entry goes into the accounts receivable line. As you can see, a company can show rip-roaring sales growth without receiving a cent of cash, which is why we need a statement of cash flows.


## Financial Statements
### A. The Balance Sheet
sometimes called a “statement of financial position”—tells you how much a company owns (its assets), how much it owes (its liabilities), and the difference between the two (its equity). Equity represents the value of the money that shareholders have invested in the firm, and if that sounds odd, think of it just like your mortgage—your equity in your home is the home’s value minus the mortgage. Stockholders’ equity in a firm is the value of the firm’s assets minus its liabilities.

The basic equation underlying a balance sheet is:
   `Assets − Liabilities = Equity`

which can also be expressed as:
   `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`

#### **I. Asset Accounts**
  
 + **Current Assets**

   Those likely to be used up or converted into cash within one business cycle, usually defined as one year.
   * **Cash and Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:** Usually contains money market funds or anything that can be liquidated quickly and with minimal price risk, whereas “short-term investments” is similar to cash—usually, bonds that have less than a year to maturity and earn a higher rate of return than cash but would take a bit of effort to sell.
   * **Accounts Receivable:** Accounts receivable are bills that the company hasn’t yet collected but for which it expects to receive payment soon. Ff accounts receivable are rising much faster than sales, the firm is booking a large amount of revenue for which it has not yet received payment. This can be a sign of trouble because it may mean that the firm is offering looser credit terms to increase sales. *Note: comparing the growth rate of accounts receivable with the growth rate of sales is a good way to judge whether a company is doing a good job collecting the money that it’s owed by customers. Both should increase with similar rates*
   * **Inventories:** Important to watch in manufacturing and retail firms. Their value on the balance sheet should be taken with a grain of salt. e.g. Although a construction firm could probably get a decent price if it needed to sell off some extra steel girders it had lying around in inventory, a retailer that needed to sell last fall’s teen fashions would likely have to take pennies on the dollar.
   Inventories soak up capital—cash that’s been converted into inventory sitting in a warehouse can’t be used for anything else.
   :white_check_mark:Inventory turnover by dividing a company’s cost of goods sold by its inventory level.

 + **Investments**

   Invested in either longer term bonds or in the stock of other companies. 

+ **Intangible Assets**

   *Goodwill:* The difference between the price the acquiring company pays and tangible value—or equity—of the target company. e.g. The majority of Coca-Cola’s value is not in the firm’s buildings and equipment; it’s in the powerful brand that Coke has built up over the past several decades. If some firm were to buy Coke, it would have to pay far more than the book value of Coke’s equity, and that extra amount is called goodwill. View this account with extreme skepticism because most companies tend to overpay for their targets, means the value of goodwill that shows up on the balance sheet is very often far more than the asset is actually worth. Think twice if goodwill is asset or not.
   
#### **II. Liability Accounts**
   
+ **Current Liabilities**

   Current liabilities are the flip side of current assets: money the company expects to pay out within a year.
   * **Accounts Payable:** Bills the company owes to somebody else and are due to be paid within a year
   * **Short-Term Borrowings:**  Money the company has borrowed for a term of less than a year, usually to meet short-term needs. Especially important for companies in financial distress because the entire amount often has to be paid back quickly.
   
+ **Non-Current Liabilities**
   
   Money the company owes one year or more in the future. Though you’ll sometimes see a variety of line items under this heading, the most important one by far is long-term debt. This represents money the company has borrowed—usually by issuing bonds, though sometimes from a bank—that doesn’t need to be paid back for a few years
   
#### **III. Stockholders’ Equity**
   Retained earnings, which basically records the amount of capital a company has generated over its lifetime—minus dividends and stock buybacks, which represent funds that have already been returned to shareholders. Retained earnings is a cumulative account; therefore, each year that the company makes a profit and doesn’t pay it all out as dividends, retained earnings increase. *Think of this account as a company’s long-term track record at generating profits.*

### B. The Income Statement
* **Revenue (Sales):** How much money the company has brought in during a quarter or a year.
* **Cost of Sales:** The expenses most directly involved in creating revenue, such as labor costs, raw materials (for manufacturers), or the wholesale price of goods (for retailers).
* **Gross Profit:** `Revenue - Cost of Sales`
* **Gross Margin:** `Gross Profit % (Revenue)`
* **Operating Expenses or Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):** :white_check_mark:A lower percentage of operating expenses relative to sales generally means a tighter, more cost-effective firm. (Compare with competitors)
* **Depreciation and Amortization:** When a company buys an asset intended to last a long time, such as a new building or a piece of machinery, it charges off a portion of the cost of that asset on its income statement over a series of years.
* **Nonrecurring Charges/Gains:** e.g. the cost of closing a factory or the gain from selling a division. Ideally, you’d want to see this area of the income statement blank most of the time.
* **Operating Income:** This number is equal to revenues minus cost of sales and all operating expenses. Theoretically, it represents the profit the company made from its actual operations, as opposed to interest income, one-time gains, and so forth. In practice, companies often include nonrecurring expenses (such as write-offs) in figuring operating income, and you have to add back one-time charges (or subtract one-time gains) yourself. Operating income is as close to a solid bottom-line number as you’re going to get for most firms. You can use it to calculate an operating margin, which is fairly comparable across firms and across industries.
* **Interest Income/Expense:** Represents interest the company has paid on bonds it has issued or received on bonds or cash that it owns. This tells you the extent to which a firm’s profits can cover needed interest payments.
* **Taxes:** If the tax rate for a company you’re analyzing is much lower than this, find out why, and find out whether that tax advantage is likely to be permanent or temporary.
* **Net Income:** The company’s profit after all expenses have been paid. Don’t forget that it can be wildly distorted by one-time charges and/or investment income.
* **Number of Shares (Basic and Diluted):** Basic shares include only actual shares of stock, and you should pretty much ignore it. Given the amount of egregious granting of stock options that has occurred over the past several years, it’s the **diluted number** that you’ll want to look at, because you want to know the degree to which your stake in the firm could potentially be shrunk (or diluted) if all those option-holders convert their options into shares.
* **Earnings per Share (Basic and Diluted):** `Net income / number of shares` Without looking at cash flow and many other factors, it’s mostly meaningless

### C. The Statement of Cash Flows
