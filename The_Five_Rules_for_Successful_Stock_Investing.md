### The Five Rules:
1. Do your homework: Know the business inside and out 
    * Reading the annual report cover to cover
    * Checking out industry competitors
    * Going through past financial statements
2. Find [economic moats](#economic-moat).
3. Have a margin of safety:

   Include a margin of safety into the price you’re willing to pay for a stock. The size of your margin of safety should be larger for shakier firms with uncertain futures and smaller for solid firms with reasonably predictable earnings.

4. Hold for the long haul.
5. Know when to sell.
    * Did You Make a Mistake?
    * Have the Fundamentals Deteriorated?
    * Has the Stock Risen Too Far above Its Intrinsic Value?
    * Is There Something Better You Can Do with the Money?
    * Do You Have Too Much Money in One Stock?

### The seven mistakes to avoid:
1. Swinging for the fences: Loading up your portfolio with risky, all-or-nothing stocks.
2. Believing that it’s different this time
3. Falling in love with products: Geat products do not necessarily translate into great profits.
4. Panicking when the market is down: Think for yourself and seek out bargains in parts of the market that everyone else has forsaken,rather than buying the flavor of the month in the financial press.
5. Trying to time the market: There is no strategy that consistently tells you when to be in the market and when to be out of it, and anyone who says otherwise usually has a market-timing service to sell you.
6. Ignoring valuation
7. Relying on earnings for the whole story: At the end of the day, cash flow is what matters (see [Accrual Accounting](#accrual-accounting)), not earnings. For a host of reasons, accounting-based earnings per share can be made to say just about whatever a company’s management wants them to, but cash flow is much harder to fiddle with.

## [Economic Moat](#economic-moat)
### To analyze a company’s economic moat, follow these four steps:
1. Evaluate the firm’s historical profitability. Has the firm been able to generate a solid return on its assets (ROA) and on shareholders’ equity (ROE) ? This is the true litmus test of whether a firm has built an economic moat around itself.
2. If the firm has solid returns on capital and consistent profitability, assess the sources of the firm’s profits. Why is the company able to keep competitors at bay? What keeps competitors from stealing its profits?
3. Estimate how long a firm will be able to hold off competitors, which is the company’s competitive advantage period. Some firms can fend off competitors for just a few years, and some firms may be able to do it for decades.
4. Analyze the industry’s competitive structure. How do firms in this industry compete with one another? Is it an attractive industry with many profitable firms or a hypercompetitive one in which participants struggle just to stay afloat?

### Five ways that an individual firm can build sustainable competitive advantage:
1. Creating real product differentiation through superior technology or features
2. Creating perceived product differentiation through a trusted brand or reputation
3. Driving costs down and offering a similar product or service at a lower price
4. Locking in customers by creating high switching costs
5. Locking out competitors by creating high barriers to entry or high barriers to success:
    * The most obvious way to lock out competitors is to acquire some kind of regulatory exclusivity.
    * A much more durable strategy for locking out competitors is to take advantage of the network effect.

### Think about an economic moat in two dimensions. 
* **Depth** - How much money the firm can make
* **Width** - How long the firm can sustain above-average profits.

e.g. Technology firms often have very deep but very narrow moats because technology moves fast
Estimating how long a moat will last is tough stuff, but you need to at least give it some thought, even if you can’t come up with a precise answer. Just being able to separate firms into three buckets—a few years, several years, and many years—is very useful.

### [Accrual accounting](#accrual-accounting)
e.g. Colgate sells a few cases of toothpaste to Joe’s Corner Store for $1,000 on February 15 but gives Joe 60 days to pay because he’s a regular customer and has a good track record of paying his bills on time. March 31 rolls around, Joe hasn’t paid yet, and Colgate closes its books for the quarter. Colgate shows $1,000 in sales on its income statement because it shipped the toothpaste to Joe—according to the income statement, the sale is complete, regardless of whether Colgate has received payment. But because Joe hasn’t ponied up the grand yet, Colgate will post an entry on its balance sheet to show that Joe owes Colgate $1,000. The entry goes into the accounts receivable line. As you can see, a company can show rip-roaring sales growth without receiving a cent of cash, which is why we need a statement of cash flows.


## Financial Statements
### A. The Balance Sheet
sometimes called a “statement of financial position”—tells you how much a company owns (its assets), how much it owes (its liabilities), and the difference between the two (its equity). Equity represents the value of the money that shareholders have invested in the firm, and if that sounds odd, think of it just like your mortgage—your equity in your home is the home’s value minus the mortgage. Stockholders’ equity in a firm is the value of the firm’s assets minus its liabilities.

The basic equation underlying a balance sheet is:
   `Assets − Liabilities = Equity`

which can also be expressed as:
   `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`

#### **I. Asset Accounts**
  
 + **Current Assets**

   Those likely to be used up or converted into cash within one business cycle, usually defined as one year.
   * **Cash and Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:** Usually contains money market funds or anything that can be liquidated quickly and with minimal price risk, whereas “short-term investments” is similar to cash—usually, bonds that have less than a year to maturity and earn a higher rate of return than cash but would take a bit of effort to sell.
   * **Accounts Receivable:** Accounts receivable are bills that the company hasn’t yet collected but for which it expects to receive payment soon. Ff accounts receivable are rising much faster than sales, the firm is booking a large amount of revenue for which it has not yet received payment. This can be a sign of trouble because it may mean that the firm is offering looser credit terms to increase sales. *Note: comparing the growth rate of accounts receivable with the growth rate of sales is a good way to judge whether a company is doing a good job collecting the money that it’s owed by customers. Both should increase with similar rates*
   * **Inventories:** Important to watch in manufacturing and retail firms. Their value on the balance sheet should be taken with a grain of salt. e.g. Although a construction firm could probably get a decent price if it needed to sell off some extra steel girders it had lying around in inventory, a retailer that needed to sell last fall’s teen fashions would likely have to take pennies on the dollar.
   Inventories soak up capital—cash that’s been converted into inventory sitting in a warehouse can’t be used for anything else.
   :white_check_mark:Inventory turnover by dividing a company’s cost of goods sold by its inventory level.

 + **Investments**

   Invested in either longer term bonds or in the stock of other companies. 

+ **Intangible Assets**

   *Goodwill:* The difference between the price the acquiring company pays and tangible value—or equity—of the target company. e.g. The majority of Coca-Cola’s value is not in the firm’s buildings and equipment; it’s in the powerful brand that Coke has built up over the past several decades. If some firm were to buy Coke, it would have to pay far more than the book value of Coke’s equity, and that extra amount is called goodwill. View this account with extreme skepticism because most companies tend to overpay for their targets, means the value of goodwill that shows up on the balance sheet is very often far more than the asset is actually worth. Think twice if goodwill is asset or not.
   
#### **II. Liability Accounts**
   
+ **Current Liabilities**

   Current liabilities are the flip side of current assets: money the company expects to pay out within a year.
   * **Accounts Payable:** Bills the company owes to somebody else and are due to be paid within a year
   * **Short-Term Borrowings:**  Money the company has borrowed for a term of less than a year, usually to meet short-term needs. Especially important for companies in financial distress because the entire amount often has to be paid back quickly.
   
+ **Non-Current Liabilities**
   
   Money the company owes one year or more in the future. Though you’ll sometimes see a variety of line items under this heading, the most important one by far is long-term debt. This represents money the company has borrowed—usually by issuing bonds, though sometimes from a bank—that doesn’t need to be paid back for a few years
   
#### **III. Stockholders’ Equity**
   Retained earnings, which basically records the amount of capital a company has generated over its lifetime—minus dividends and stock buybacks, which represent funds that have already been returned to shareholders. Retained earnings is a cumulative account; therefore, each year that the company makes a profit and doesn’t pay it all out as dividends, retained earnings increase. *Think of this account as a company’s long-term track record at generating profits.*

### B. The Income Statement
* **Revenue (Sales):** How much money the company has brought in during a quarter or a year.
* **Cost of Revenue (Cost of Sales):** The expenses most directly involved in creating revenue, such as labor costs, raw materials (for manufacturers), or the wholesale price of goods (for retailers).
* **Gross Profit:** `Revenue - Cost of Sales`
* **Gross Margin:** `Gross Profit % (Revenue)`
* **Operating Expenses or Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):** :white_check_mark:A lower percentage of operating expenses relative to sales generally means a tighter, more cost-effective firm. (Compare with competitors)
* **Depreciation and Amortization:** When a company buys an asset intended to last a long time, such as a new building or a piece of machinery, it charges off a portion of the cost of that asset on its income statement over a series of years.
* **Nonrecurring Charges/Gains:** e.g. the cost of closing a factory or the gain from selling a division. Ideally, you’d want to see this area of the income statement blank most of the time.
* **Operating Income:** This number is equal to revenues minus cost of sales and all operating expenses. Theoretically, it represents the profit the company made from its actual operations, as opposed to interest income, one-time gains, and so forth. In practice, companies often include nonrecurring expenses (such as write-offs) in figuring operating income, and you have to add back one-time charges (or subtract one-time gains) yourself. Operating income is as close to a solid bottom-line number as you’re going to get for most firms. You can use it to calculate an operating margin, which is fairly comparable across firms and across industries.
* **Interest Income/Expense:** Represents interest the company has paid on bonds it has issued or received on bonds or cash that it owns. This tells you the extent to which a firm’s profits can cover needed interest payments.
* **Taxes:** If the tax rate for a company you’re analyzing is much lower than this, find out why, and find out whether that tax advantage is likely to be permanent or temporary.
* **Net Income:** The company’s profit after all expenses have been paid. Don’t forget that it can be wildly distorted by one-time charges and/or investment income.
* **Number of Shares (Basic and Diluted):** Basic shares include only actual shares of stock, and you should pretty much ignore it. Given the amount of egregious granting of stock options that has occurred over the past several years, it’s the **diluted number** that you’ll want to look at, because you want to know the degree to which your stake in the firm could potentially be shrunk (or diluted) if all those option-holders convert their options into shares.
* **Earnings per Share (Basic and Diluted):** `Net income / number of shares` Without looking at cash flow and many other factors, it’s mostly meaningless

### C. The Statement of Cash Flows
This statement is the true touchstone for corporate value creation because it shows how much cash a company is generating from year to year—and cash is what counts. Look at the statement of cash flows first when evaluating a company to see how much cash it’s throwing off, then look at the balance sheet to test the firmness of its financial foundation, and only then look at the income statement to check out margins and such.
* **Cash flows from operating activities:** 
Tells you how much cash the company generated from its business.
   + **Net Income:** Taken from income statement
   + **Depreciation and Amortization:** Company didn’t have to pay anyone just because machines have started to wear out—so we need to add it back to net income.
   + **Tax Benefit from Employee Stock Plans:** When an employee exercises stock options, the employer gets to deduct the gain received by the employee against its corporate income. (Employee compensation is generally tax deductible.) Because the result is a lower tax bill, we need to add back the tax benefit to the already-taxed net income. Be wary of this line item—if it’s large relative to total operating cash flow and the company’s stock has been zooming upwards, you shouldn’t count on this cash being around in the future.
   + **Changes in Working Capital:** If a company is owed more money by customers this year than it was last year, accounts receivable increase and cash flow decreases; if it owes more money to suppliers, accounts payable increase and so does cash flow. Finally, if a firm pumps more money into inventory that doesn’t sell, cash flow decreases.
   + **One-Time Charges:** Need to be added back when figuring cash flow.
   + **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:** Holy grail for figuring out whether a company is generating cash.
* **Cash flows from investing activities:** 
Activities that involve acquiring or disposing of PP&E, corporate acquisitions, and any sales or purchases of investments.
   + **Capital Expenditures:** Money spent on items that last a long time, such as PP&E(Property, Plant, Eqipment) —basically, anything needed to keep the business running and growing at its current rate. *Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures equals **free cash flow**, or the amount of cash the company generates after investing in its business.*
   + **Investment Proceeds:** Money the company has made (or lost) on investing in bonds or stocks in an effort to get a better return than they could in a basic savings account.
* **Cash flow from financing activities**:
Include any transactions with the company’s owners or creditors
   + **Dividends Paid** to shareholders.
   + **Issuance/Purchase of Common Stock:** Rapidly growing companies often issue large amounts of new stock, which can dilute the value of existing shares but which also give the company cash for expansion. Slower growing companies that generate a lot of free cash flow tend to buy back significant amounts of their own stock, though companies that issue many stock options to their employees also buy back stock to minimize dilution. Firms that grant their employees a ton of options and then spend corporate cash on repurchases are essentially selling shares to their employees at low prices and buying it back on the open market at much higher prices, which is not the best use of capital.
   + **Issuance/Repayments of Debt:** Tells you whether the company has borrowed money or repaid money it previously borrowed.

If you can’t understand how a dollar flows from a company’s customers back through to shareholders, something’s amiss. Either the company’s business model is too confusing or you need to do more digging before committing any of your money.

### The 10-Minute Test
**1. Does the Firm Pass a Minimum Quality Hurdle?**
Avoid Companies with miniscule market capitalizations and firms that trade on the bulletin boards (or pink sheets).
Avoid firms that don’t file regular financials.
Avoid IPOs, IPOs are rarely bargains. The big exception is firms that are spun off from larger parent companies.

**2. Has the Company Ever Made an Operating Profit?**
Unless you’re looking for an alternative to lottery tickets, take a pass on any firm that hasn’t yet proven it can earn a buck.

**3. Does the Company Generate Consistent Cash Flow from Operations?**
Fast-growing firms can sometimes report profits before they generate cash—but every company has to generate cash eventually.

**4. Are Returns on Equity Consistently above 10 Percent, with Reasonable Leverage?**
If a nonfinancial firm can’t post ROEs over 10 percent for four years out of every five, for example, odds are good that it’s not worth your time. For financial firms, raise your ROE bar to 12 percent. Don’t forget to check leverage to make sure that it’s in line with industry norms.
One exception is that cyclical firms

**5. Is Earnings Growth Consistent or Erratic?**
The best companies post reasonably consistent growth rates. If a firm’s earnings bounce all over the place, it’s either in an extremely volatile industry or it’s regularly getting shellacked by competitors.

**6. How Clean Is the Balance Sheet?**
Firms with a lot of debt require extra care because their capital structures are often very complicated. If a nonbank firm has a financial leverage ratio above about 4—or a debt-to-equity ratio over 1.0 Check following:
   a. Is the firm in a stable business?
   b. Has debt been going down or up as a percentage of total assets?

**7. Does the Firm Generate Free Cash Flow?**
The one exception is - it’s fine for a firm to be generating negative free cash flow if it’s investing that cash wisely in projects that are likely to pay off well in the future.

**8. How Much “Other” Is There?**
Numerous one-time charges hint at a management team that may be trying to burnish poor results.

**9. Has the Number of Shares Outstanding Increased Markedly over the Past Several Years?**
If shares outstanding are consistently increasing by more than around 2 percent per year—assuming no big acquisitions—think long and hard before investing in the firm.
However, if the number of shares is actually shrinking, the company potentially gets a big gold star. Just be careful that the company isn’t buying it's own overvalued stock. You don’t want to see a company buying its own overvalued stock any more than you want to invest in overvalued shares yourself.

**10. Start valuing the stock.** Look at the stock’s valuation multiples relative to the market, the industry, and the stock’s historical valuation ranges. If the firm has low reinvestment needs, low risk, high returns on capital, or a high growth rate, be prepared to accept a higher price-to-earnings ratio. Do at least a very rough discounted cash flow valuation—think about how much free cash flow the firm is likely to generate next year, how fast it will grow, and add the discounted value of these cash flows to a perpetuity value. If your estimated intrinsic value is very different from the market price, check your assumptions. Are you being too pessimistic or too optimistic? If you recheck your assumptions, the stock still looks undervalued, and your multiple-based analysis didn’t scream “sell,” you might just have uncovered a great investment.
