### Preface
Markets require different tools at different times, and a person with a single tool could end up as a man with a hammer.

### RAMESH DAMANI
* When you have a great idea, you need to back up the truck and buy. It is so difficult to do, because you are scared and there is also self doubt.
* When a bull market gets over, the leaders are squashed completely. the new markets will have new leaders.
* **On higher PE stocks**: The valuations are decided by the markets and it is not my job to judge them
* An investor who is price action-oriented will think that the stock has tripled, so let me take some money home. While the fundamentalist will understand that he has bought something that has deep value and even if the stock has tripled, it doesn't mean that the value has been extracted
one has to make an outsized bet only when they have a great company. A great company doesn't happen overnight - they happen once in every two to three years, or at the end of every bear market. Thats when you have to scoop up.

### RAAMDEO AGRAWAL
* You have to take on problems with a smiling face and not crib about them. We learnt slowly but steadily.
* A key aspect of being an entrepreneur is learning how to delegate. If you want to build something big, you have to learn to delegate and then control
you mature with time - 1 have seen 50-70% drawdowns thrice in my life, so that has made my thinking very robust and independent.
* **QGLP Framework** - It is in that sequence
  - Quality of Business - Great, Good and Gruesome as defined by Warren Buffet
    - The Good businesses have high return on tangible assets of the company.
    - The Great businesses also have high return but are able to deploy additional capital even at higher rates.
    - The Gruesome businesses which earns less than cost of capital and the company tries to grow, making it a bottomless pit of capital destruction of return.
  - then Quality of Management, - Management should have great competencies, passion for growth and above all unquestionable integrity.
  - Growth, 
  - Longevity of Growth,
  - finally a reasonable valuation

### RAJASHEKAR IYER
* **On stocks trading at high PE** - I would hold them anyways till they reach their worth. Ifthey traded above their worth, I would still hold, on the logic that stocks can trade above or below their "fair value" for a period of time. So when they trade above their fair value, it does not mean that I will sell them automatically. But I will make a mental note that the only reason I am holding this stock is because it's going up. So when the price starts falling, I will sell the stock.
* **Pyramiding** - The step-up approach allows one to put in a large proportion while managing the risk of capital loss. Then there is no reason for stock to fall below your purchase price without a major change in the company's or the markets outlook
* There might even be some good companies that you end up rejecting, but it doesn't matter. The ones you find and invest in are what matters
* One should be able to read a lot, have a curious and analytical mind, and develop the capability to learn from experience
* **Stock Rejection Criteria**
  - Meaningful RoE generation in 10 years history
  - Lack of scalability
  - Poor quality of management
* **Type A & Type B errors**
  - Type A error is where I make a mistake in investing in a stock I should not have. Type A is a problem because my money, however much it is, is limited.
  - Type B is where I negate a stock which is good. Type B is not a problem because opportunities are unlimited, and if you have been in the market long enough, you will realize that there is no dearth of opportunities
* When companies are crossing the Rs. 100 crore level of net profit for the first time, the valuation multiple expands because the growth opportunities for the company expand
* When we buy stocks at expensive valuations, even if we make money on these stocks, we cannot make this kind of exceptional return on them. The only way to make exceptional returns is to find growth companies at cheap valuations.
* The risk is better managed by limiting the loss one would take on a position
* If you build too many "text book" processes, you become stifled and you can't be creative. The idea is to let yourself be creative, give yourself some freedom to do what you want to do. Then, if you analyze the results and keep those that worked well and drop those that resulted in poor results, your process will get built. We typically build process depending on what has worked for us in the past 
* You don't buy a bad management in a bad business; you can buy a good management in a mediocre business if they manage the business exceptionally.
* When divided stocks in three buckets - current earnings growth, value, and turnaround potential, maximum retunrs are made in bucket of current earnings growth

####  Investment process
 1. evaluating whether the company can grow its business value meaningfully in the future
    - depends on the attractiveness of the business, managements ability to allocate capital strategically, and managements ability to operate the business efficiently
    - If the growth was 'priced in'. I also like to know as much as possible about the company, the manufacturing process, credit terms, customers, suppliers etc. I also find out details about the key management personnel, even aspects like the college of the MD, his persona] habits, etc. Some of these might be relevant, some might not. But one should get all the facts, answer all the questions, and then form an opinion
 2. value the company based on its current state
    - Valuation has to take into account the company's asset values, current earnings, cash flow projections, near term growth prospects, and many other things.
    - three variables to determine the value of a business - how much they grow their sales, how much profits they can make, and what kind of capital they need to generate that sales
 3. deciding how much of your capital to allocate
    - depend on what you come up with in terms of prospect of the business and your assessment of how fairly the stock value is reflected in the price.

#### On Management Quality
* It is useful to see what a company management had said three years back and what they have done since then.
* It is always important to look at how the company is doing as compared to the industry.
* I asked him. "You are going to generate a lot of cash in the next couple of years, what will you do with all the cash?" He started laughing happily and had no clue! He eventually blew up the cash making random acquisitions.

#### Advise
* One very important habit is to rely on your own thinking. Even if you get numbers from a reliable person, you should gather your own facts and draw your own conclusions
* Reading is a very important habit.
* Writing down what you are doing and the reasons why you are doing it - whether it is buying a stock, not buying a stock, selling a stock or not selling a stock - is useful. Reviewing these at a later date will help you spot flaws in thinking that can be corrected 
* When thinking about individual investments and portfolio, think strategically and tactically. Don't let the fear of missing out drive your actions
* What other people think of you doesn't make any difference. If you are right, you will make money. You have to operate with confidence in your work and the judgment you form from such work. You don't have to look for endorsement from others.
* The ability to work hard on learning and practice. The investment process is challenging, but if one approaches it with a determination, answers will emerge. Hard work means reading more, thinking more and analyzing yourself as much as external analysis.
