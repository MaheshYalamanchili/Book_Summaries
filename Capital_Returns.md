# THE CAPITAL CYCLE:

* High current profitability often leads to overconfidence among managers, who confuse benign industry conditions with their own skill – a mistake encouraged by the media, which is constantly looking for corporate heroes and villains.
* As profits collapse, management teams are changed, capital expenditure is slashed, and the industry starts to consolidate. The reduction in investment and contraction in industry supply paves the way for a recovery of profits. For an investor who understands the capital cycle this is the moment when a beaten down stock becomes potentially interesting.
* Suffered in a number of cases where the benefits of supply side consolidation in distressed sectors was insufficient to offset a secular decline in demand.
* The great strength of the capital cycle approach lies in its adaptability. The basic insight doesn’t change. Namely, both high and low returns are likely to revert to the mean as valuation influences corporate behaviour and brings about shifts in the supply side.

## EXPLANATIONS FOR THE CAPITAL CYCLE ANOMALY
* OVERCONFIDENCE: Managers so overestimate their own skills they neglect competitive threats.
* COMPETITION NEGLECT
* INSIDE VIEW: a “value” stock, the bet is that profits will rebound more quickly than is expected and for a “growth stock,” that profits will remain elevated for longer than market expectations.
* EXTRAPOLATION
* SKEWED INCENTIVES
* PRISONER’S DILEMMA: Future demand growth can profitably accommodate expansion by a single player, but no more. If several players simultaneously expand their operations, their aggregate profits will decline at some future date.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF CAPITAL CYCLE ANALYSIS
* FOCUS ON SUPPLY RATHER THAN DEMAND: Supply prospects are far less uncertain than demand, and thus easier to forecast.
* ANALYZE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS WITHIN AN INDUSTRY
    * The negative phase of the capital cycle is characterized by industry fragmentation and increasing supply.
    * New entrants noisily trumpet their arrival in an industry. A rash of IPOs concentrated in a hot sector is a red flag; secondary share issuances another, as are increases in debt.
* CAVEAT INVESTMENT BANKER: wary of the actions of investment banks, and the work of their in-house propagandists, the brokerage analyst
* SELECTING THE RIGHT CORPORATE MANAGERS: Capital cycle analysis involves keeping a sharp eye on managers to assess their ability to allocate capital.
* GENERALISTS MAKE BETTER CAPITAL CYCLE ANALYSTS
* ADOPT A LONG-TERM APPROACH

# Selected learnings from essays:
## General:
* Focuses on not just the magnitude of a company’s profitability (the size of the pinch-point) but also its sustainability. The longer one owns shares, the more important sustainability becomes, and so we focus on companies that control their own pinch-point.
* Countries generally become more efficient in their use of raw materials as their economies develop
* Increases in miners’ capex to depreciation ratio and the decline in energy companies’ cash conversion rate served as red flags for investors
* Semiconductor industry: A fragmented supply side allied with high capital intensity and low product differentiation has led to long-term destruction of economic value. It is only very recently, with an improvement in the supply side via consolidation, that the outlook has improved.
* The starting point for company analysis is not the outlook for end demand but rather the supply side. Our goal is to find investments in depressed industries at positive inflection points in the capital cycle and in sectors with benign and stable supply side fundamentals.
* The short-term investor questions: relating typically to operating margins, earnings per share and revenue trends over the next quarter.
* The longer one owns the shares, however, the more important the firm’s underlying economics will be to performance results.
* Information with a long shelf life is far more valuable than advance knowledge of next quarter’s earnings.
* Long-term investing works not because it is more difficult, but because there is less competition out there for the really valuable bits of information.

## On Agency Problem:
* Munger then goes on: “Now tell me several instances when, if you want the physical volume to go up, the correct answer is to increase the price?”
    * the luxury good paradox
    * the customer is not involved directly in the purchasing decision, then higher prices can be used to bribe the purchaser’s agent and can result in both higher profit margins and sales volumes. From an economist’s perspective, the customer experiences an agency problem.
    * Normal relations between provider, intermediary and consumer are distorted when the consumer lacks understanding and relies on a supposedly independent intermediary.
    intermediary and the product provider has developed to the point where these parties form a tacit alliance to exploit consumer ignorance.
    * Expect the superior profitability of companies that exploit agency to endure.
e.g.
* Geberit, the Swiss sanitary systems manufacturer. The company sells its product to plumbers via wholesalers who then install them in the end-customer’s home or commercial building.
* Nobel Biocare has grown revenues at 17 per cent p.a. since 1995, and its latest operating profit margin was 24 per cent. Dentists who adopt its implant technique, which replaces the traditional crown and bridge solution, earn higher revenues. Customers end up with better teeth, and shareholders are smiling!
* In the upscale hearing aid market, a field dominated by European firms – Siemens, William Demant, GN Store Nord, and Phonak – there is a similar emphasis on continuous innovation. The fitters of hearing aids, like dentists, are keen to sell high-end products which earn them more money.
* Labtest is the Hong Kong subsidiary of Intertek, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The company’s role is to serve as a gatekeeper between Chinese consumer goods manufacturers and American retailers. We understand that the US firms select Labtest to check the prototypes of new Chinese products to ensure that they meet the appropriate specifications. Intertek charges the Chinese firms, rather than the US retailers, for this service, a fee that constitutes a relatively low proportion of the product price (less than 1 per cent of the manufacturer’s cost). This distancing of payer from the service selector lies at the heart of Labtest’s remarkable profitability – with margins around 33 per cent – alongside more obvious network and scale effects.
* whether in plumbing, dentistry, hearing aids, or product testing – involved value being transferred from the person who pays to the agent, with the producer taking a large slice of the pie.

### Systematic flaws in the specialist analyst model, which largely derive from the relationship between research analysts and the companies they follow.
1. Too close to management
2. Too much information
3. Living in a cocoon
4. Poor incentives
5. An even worse performance metric


## High and sustainable returns
* Pricing power has arguably been the most enduring determinant of high returns. comes from:
    1. a concentrated market structure, closely associated with effective management of capacity through the demand cycle which encourages a rational approach to pricing.
    2. “intrinsic” pricing power within the product or service itself. Intrinsic pricing power is created when price is not the most important factor in a customer’s purchase decision. Most often, this property is generated by the existence of an intangible asset.
* An obvious one is consumer brands, e.g. Colgate
* the agency business models (Legrand, Assa Abloy or Geberit), where the customer relies on intermediaries (electricians, architects and plumbers respectively).
* The presence of intangible assets acts as a powerful barrier to entry. They are by nature durable, difficult to replicate and tending to economies of scale. The importance of management in this process is paramount
* The customer (scientist/lab technician) cares more about product quality, availability and service and not so much about price, orders are regular (daily) and relatively small. So price is scarcely perceptible to the customer.
* If they attempt to switch a single small supplier, pharma companies may need to get the FDA to recertify the entire production process.

## Management:

### The key elements that we look for in management;
* it has a chief executive who both understands and is able to drive the industry’s capital cycle
* allocates capital in a countercyclical manner 
* is incentivized properly (large equity stake)
* takes a dispassionate approach to selling assets when someone is prepared to overpay.

### Meetings with managers
* Look for answers to questions such as: does the CEO think in a long-term strategic way about the business? Understand how the capital cycle operates in their industry? Seem intelligent, energetic and passionate about the business? And interact with colleagues and others in an encouraging way? Appear trustworthy and honest? Act in a shareholder-friendly way even down to the smallest detail?
* Fastenal executives being required to share hotel rooms at conferences. Company offices are said to be equipped with second-hand furniture.
* Costco employees stay on longer, thus saving on training costs. Turnover for employees who have been with the company for more than one year is a paltry 5 per cent. Loyal employees are more likely to excel. Costco is regularly rated as excellent for customer service.
* A strong corporate culture constitutes an intangible asset, potentially as valuable as a high-profile brand or network of customer relationships.
* Just as positive cultures take a number of different forms, so too can negative ones. An obsession with growing earnings occasionally results in outright fraud.
* “The danger sign is always when a manager does not understand the business that he or she is in.”
* “Don’t postpone until tomorrow what you can delegate today.”

## Companies under family control
* Invest in companies which remain under family control. Unfortunately, this is not without its pitfalls. It’s often the case that the interests of the family are elevated above outside investors. Aside from this, such businesses are often prone to nepotism and paralysing family disputes. Everyone knows the saying that rich families go from rags to riches and back to rags in three generations. As a result, many investors prefer to stay away.

### List of common family deficiencies, any one of which is liable to undermine a company’s success:
1. Lack of family unity
2. Loss of business acumen
3. Self-dealing
4. Poor succession planning
5. Politics of rent-seeking: there’s the danger of a political backlash.

## Europe:
* European policymakers have prevented various industries – in particular the employment-heavy auto sector and the politically sensitive Continental banking sector – from consolidating. As a result, the operation of the capital cycle has been arrested. This is bad news for investors as the problems of excess capacity and weak profitability have not been addressed. It also augurs ill for the eurozone economy, which appears doomed to low productivity and weak economic growth. These problems have been exacerbated by the post-crisis policy of ultra-low interest rates which, by lowering funding costs, have allowed weak businesses – the corporate zombies – to continue limping along.

## On Banks:
* Better to wait for the rise in non-performing loans and asset write-downs, before raising our exposure.

### Seven Deadly Sins of Banking.
* Imprudent asset-liability mismatches on the balance sheet
* Supporting asset-liability mismatches by clients
* Lending to “Can’t Pay, Won’t Pay” types
* Reaching for growth in unfamiliar areas
* Engaging in off-balance sheet lending
* Getting sucked into virtuous/vicious cycle dynamics
* Relying on the rearview mirror

## On China:
* Combination of cheap capital, excess investment and the failure of capital to exit low return industries has rendered the Middle Kingdom something of a no-go area for capital cycle investors,
* China’s state capitalism model has two further characteristics, both of which are unique. First, the bulk of corporate capital is raised via the domestic banking system, with long experience suggesting that repayment of the loans is optional. The lifeline provided by debt forgiveness allows businesses with ultra-low returns to survive. Second, centuries of municipal and provincial rivalry stimulate copycat projects across the country. The nine hundred breweries in China are partly the result of this provincial rivalry – indeed, in some parts of the country beer is cheaper than water.
* Credit costs are low and leverage is high for China banks.
