### Chapter One: The Man Who Cloned Warren Buffett
--------------------
- "Compounding is a very simple idea. Cloning is a very simple idea. Telling the truth is a very simple idea," he says. But when you apply a handful of powerful ideas with obsessive fervor, the cumulative effect "becomes unbeatable."
- Hedonism is an unreliable route to happiness
- The ideal amount to give your kids is enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.
### Chapter Two: The Willingness to Be Lonely
--------------------
#### On Investing
--------------------
- If you don't really care about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor.
   
   > Care much more about being right and winning than gaining social acceptance or approval
#### Investing principles
--------------------
1. **Beware of emotion**: "Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses."
2. **Beware of your own ignorance**: which is "probably an even bigger problem than emotion.… So many people buy something with the tiniest amount of information. They don't really understand what it is that they're buying."
    
    Investing is so difficult, he concluded, that even the best investors should assume that they'll be right no more than two-thirds of the time, however hard they work.
3. Diversify broadly to protect yourself from your own fallibility.
4. Successful investing requires patience.
5. The best way to find bargains is to study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.
6. One of the most important things as an investor is not to chase fads.
#### On Life
--------------------
- Replace any negative thought with the statement "I give thanks for the abundance of good in my life."
- When faced with difficulties, he suggested uttering a phrase such as "This comes to bless me."
### Chapter Three: Everything Changes
--------------------
#### First, Be Lucky. Second, Be Humble
--------------------
Be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities.

- If he wanted to add value as an investor, he should avoid the most efficient markets and focus exclusively on less efficient ones.
- Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough.
- Luck is not enough, equally, intelligence is not enough, hard work is not enough, and even perseverance is not necessarily enough. You need some combination of all four.
#### Know What You Don’t Know
--------------------
Recognizing that we can't forecast the future might sound like a disheartening admission of weakness. In reality, it's a tremendous advantage to acknowledge our limitations and operate within the boundaries of what's possible. Out of weakness comes strength.
#### Find Order within Chaos
--------------------
- "It's easy to invest in dreams," he says. "The challenge is to discern value in what's tangible today."
- When analyzing any asset, what Marks wants to know, above all, is "the amount of optimism that's in the price.
- The future may be unpredictable, but this recurring process of boom and bust is remarkably predictable. Once we recognize this underlying pattern, we're no longer flying blind.
- "When things or people are successful, it usually brings in hubris, overexpansion, a belief that we can't miss, which is very dangerous."
#### Most of the Time, the End of the World Doesn’t Happen
--------------------
- Never thinks of the future as a single predetermined scenario that's bound to occur. View it instead as a "distribution of different possibilities." His standard approach is to assign probabilities to each of these "alternative futures."
- The importance of admitting that we can't predict or control the future.
- The benefits of studying the patterns of the past and using them as a rough guide to what could happen next.
- The inevitability that cycles will reverse and reckless excess will be punished.
- The possibility of turning cyclicality to our advantage by behaving countercyclically.
#### The Question Is, Do You Push the Limits?
--------------------
- The need for humility, skepticism, and prudence in order to achieve long-term financial success in an uncertain world.
- Both in markets and life, the goal isn't to embrace risk or eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.
- Given that everything changes, we shouldn't get too carried away when times are good or too despondent when they're bad.
- Learning to experience the world with "radical fullness" by focusing on every moment with "extraordinary concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity
### Chapter Four: The Resilient Investor
--------------------
- "Because the future is uncertain, you want to minimize your risk,"
#### The Long Game
--------------------
- the secret of investing could be expressed in one word: "safety." And the key to making intelligent investment decisions was always to begin by asking, "How much can I lose?"
- "Our goal is not to try to become rich quickly. It's resilient wealth creation."
- The beauty of compounding is small advantages build over decades into an overwhelming margin of victory.
#### Everything Fades
--------------------
- preparing for a future that may look nothing like his recent experience.
- "You want to be structured to participate in the march of mankind, but to survive the dips along the way."
- attributes success to a consistent focus on "risk mitigation," "error elimination," and "prudent acts of omission." In essence, "it's winning by not losing."
- In markets, as in life, so much hinges on our ability to survive the dips.
#### Five Rules for Resilience
--------------------
1. Respect uncertainty
2. Reduce or eliminate debt, avoid leverage, and beware of excessive expenses, all of which can make us dependent on the kindness of strangers.
3. Instead of fixating on short-term gains or beating benchmarks, we should place greater emphasis on becoming shock resistant, avoiding ruin, and staying in the game.
4. Beware of overconfidence and complacency.
5. As informed realists, we should be keenly aware of our exposure to risk and should always require a margin of safety.
### Chapter Five: Simplicity Is the Ultimate Sophistication
--------------------
#### The Simplicity That Lies on the Other Side of Complexity
--------------------
- Complexity can be a particularly seductive trap for clever people.
- "For every company, there are a few key investment variables," he says, "and the rest of the stuff is noise."
--------------------
Depending on the business, Greenblatt uses some combination of four standard valuation techniques.
- Method 1: he performs a discounted cash flow analysis, calculating the net present value of the company’s estimated future earnings.
- Method 2: he assesses the company’s relative value, comparing it to the price of similar businesses.
- Method 3: he estimates the company’s acquisition value, figuring out what an informed buyer might pay for it. 
- Method 4: he calculates the company’s liquidation value, analyzing what it would be worth if it closed and sold its assets.
#### Unfair Bets and Ugly Ducklings
--------------------
- 90% of the cases, the market will recognize that value within two or three years.
- always sought "asymmetric" propositions where "I can't lose much and maybe I'll make a lot."
- "It's easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren't looking at."
- "stick to buying good companies (ones that have a high return on capital) and to buying those companies only at bargain prices (at prices that give you a high earnings yield)."
#### Principles underpinning any strategy
--------------------
1. Stocks are ownership shares of businesses, which must be valued.
2. They should be bought only when they trade for less than they are worth.
3. In the long run, the market is rational and will (more or less) reflect the fair value of these businesses.
#### Four Simple Lessons
1. You don't need the optimal strategy. You need a sensible strategy that's good enough to achieve your financial goals.
2. Your strategy should be so simple and logical that you understand it, believe in it to your core, and can stick with it even in the difficult times when it no longer seems to work.
3. You need to ask yourself whether you truly have the skills and temperament to beat the market.
4. It's important to remember that you can be a rich and successful investor without attempting to beat the market.
### Chapter Six: Nick & Zak's Excellent Adventure
--------------------
- "The very rapid rejection of things made life very straightforward," says Zakaria. "It was all about quality.… Money was secondary.
- Build your house on rock rather than sand
- "The firm is deferring profits today in order to extend the life of the franchise. Of course Wall Street would love profits today but that's just Wall Street's obsession with short-term outcomes."
#### Five Lessons with a Long Shelf Life
--------------------
1. Pursue quality as a guiding principle in business, investing, and life
2. There is the idea of focusing on whatever has the longest shelf life, while always downplaying the ephemeral.
3. There is the realization that one particular business model - scale economies shared - creates a virtuous cycle that can generate sustainable wealth over long periods.
4. It's not necessary to behave unethically or unscrupulously to achieve spectacular success, even in a voraciously capitalistic business where self-serving behavior is the norm.
5. In a world that's increasingly geared toward short-termism and instant gratification, a tremendous advantage can be gained by those who move consistently in the opposite direction.
    >I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.
### Chapter Seven: High-Performance Habits
--------------------
>I think that people underestimate - until they get older - they underestimate just how important habits are, and how difficult they are to change when you’re forty-five or fifty, and how important it is that you form the right ones when you’re young. - *Warren Buffett*
--------------------
- Be "directionally correct," not perfect
- Resounding victories tend to be the result of small, incremental advances and improvements sustained over long stretches of time.
#### The Aggregation of Marginal Gains
--------------------
- "You can only control the effort and the dedication and the giving of one hundred percent of yourself to the task at hand. And then whatever happens, happens."
- Time is the enemy of bad habits and the friend of good habits.
- The modest benefits generated by smart habits continue to compound over many years.
    >What we need is a selection of sensible habits that are directionally correct and sustainable - habits that give us a marginal advantage that will compound over time.
#### Bring the Heat
--------------------
 - There's no substitute for hard work.
 - "You can't mimic them because you're not them," he says. "Learn it and adapt it and modify it into your own process."
#### The Art of Subtraction
--------------------
- They focus almost exclusively on what they're best at and what matters most to them. Their success derives from this fierce insistence on concentrating deeply in a relatively narrow area while disregarding countless distractions that could interfere with their pursuit of excellence.
- Don't lie to themselves about what they are and aren't good at.
- The art of subtraction is incalculably important, particularly in an age of information overload when our minds can so easily become scattered.
- Consciously **designed his physical environment** to support contemplation.
#### Simple takeaways to be successful and fulfilled
--------------------
1. We need to decide what we care about most and be honest with ourselves about what we do best. 
2. We need to adopt daily habits that enable us to improve continuously where it truly counts - and to subtract habits that divert us.
    > It's worth writing down a list of beneficial habits that should be part of our daily routine. But it's equally valuable to compile a Do Not Do list, reminding us of all the ingenious ways in which we habitually distract or undermine ourselves.
### Chapter Eight: Don't Be a Fool
#### Stragtegies to be non-idiotic
1. As safeguard against stupidity: imagine a dreadful outcome; work backward by asking yourself what misguided actions might lead you to that sorry fate; and then scrupulously avoid that self-destructive behavior.
    >Inversion of looking for the trouble and trying to avoid it keeps you out of a lot of messes.… It's a precaution
    
    >For a start, he says, "Don't pay too much. Don't go for businesses that are prone to obsolescence and destruction. Don't invest with crooks and idiots. Don't invest in things you don't understand."
2. Actively collecting examples of other people's foolish behavior is an invaluable antidote to idiocy. In fact, it's the second great anti-stupidity technique we should learn from Munger.
3. I know I'll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful trick to learn.
    >He acknowledges his errors, learns the lessons, and moves forward without wallowing in regret.
    
    >Nothing matters more than averting obvious errors with the potential for catastrophic consequences.

4. Idea of adopting a few standard practices and unbendable rules 
    >"adherence to process" is an indispensable safeguard: "Always honor it because that's going to keep you out of trouble."
    
    >study "financial disasters" involving "the guys that are really good" because "you want to keep reminding yourself of how difficult this business is.… Humility is extremely important in investing. Always, always think about your own limitations."
5. Unflinching determination to seek out "disconfirming evidence" that might disprove even their most cherished beliefs.
    >The reluctance to reexamine our views and change our minds is one of the greatest impediments to rational thinking. Instead of keeping an open mind, we tend consciously and unconsciously to prioritize information that reinforces what we believe.
    
    >That willingness to welcome the discovery of our own errors is an inestimable advantage.
    
    >It's harder to think objectively about a stock once he owns it, because of the endowment effect - a cognitive bias that makes us value what we own more highly than what we don't
6. Emphasis on adopting systematic analytical procedures.
    >Instead of quoting Munger, it's best to describe these pitfalls in your own words, so you can internalize his insights and make them your own. 
    
    >perform a "bull/bear analysis" for every company they analyzed - another basic procedure that entails writing two thesis statements (one positive, one negative), each on a single page of its own. 

7. Pause when those hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness, pain, and stress might be impairing your judgment and postpone important decisions until you are in a state in which his brain is more likely to function well.
    >"The reason you meditate is not because it's important on a specific day. The regular practice of meditation will help you handle the hard setbacks and will keep you constantly prepared for them

    >"I know that anger is stupid. I know that resentment is stupid. I know self-pity is stupid. So I don't do them.… I'm trying not to be stupid every day, all day."
#### Lessons of a Lifetime
--------------------
- Figure out a game where you have an advantage, and it has to be something that you're deeply interested in.
- Conduct your life so that you can handle the 50% decline with aplomb and grace. Don't try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn't come, you're not being aggressive enough."
- If you want to have a good partner, be a good partner.
### Epilogue: Beyond Rich
- "People who just keep piling up stuff  end up with a whole lot of stuff at the end, but they've spent their whole life just chasing it."
- The quality of our lives depends less on our finances than on inner attributes such as equanimity, acceptance, hope, trust, appreciation, and determined optimism.
- Resilience is a prerequisite for success in markets and life.
- Everyone I've interviewed have been through the wringer, no matter how rich or renowned they may be.
- Facing adversity is a blessing. It eventually leads to higher highs.

--------------------
>If your life is more important than your principles, you sacrifice your principles. If your principles are more important than your life, you sacrifice your life.
--------------------

- "By your own thoughts you make or mar your life, your world, your universe," Allen preached. "As you build within by the power of thought, so will your outward life and circumstances shape themselves accordingly
- The soul that is pure, unselfish, and noble is gravitating with equal precision toward happiness and prosperity.
- Never compromise what you believe in. Never be satisfied with what you are, only with what you can be. And never give up.
