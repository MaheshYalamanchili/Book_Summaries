### PREPARING TO INVEST
* Don’t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals.
* Take advantage of what you already know.
* Look for opportunities that haven’t yet been discovered and certified by Wall Street - companies that are “off the radar scope.”
* Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.
* Invest in companies, not in the stock market.
* Ignore short-term fluctuations.
* Large profits can be made in common stocks.
* Large losses can be made in common stocks.
* Predicting the economy or short-term direction of the stock market is futile.
* The long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and also far superior to the long-term returns from bonds.
* Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless stud-poker hand.
* Common stocks aren’t for everyone, nor even for all phases of a person’s life.
* The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and products years before the professionals.
* Having an edge will help you make money in stocks.
* In the stock market, one in the hand is worth ten in the bush.

### Stalking the Tenbagger
* You don’t have to be a vice president at Exxon to sense the growing prosperity in that company, or a turnaround in oil prices.
You can be a roustabout, a geologist, a driller, a supplier, a gas-station owner, a grease monkey, or even a client at the gas pumps.
* You don’t have to work in Kodak’s main office to learn that the new generation of inexpensive, easy-to-use, high-quality 35mm cameras from Japan is reviving the photo industry, and that film sales are up.
You could be a film salesman, the owner of a camera store, or a clerk in a camera store.
You could also be the local wedding photographer who notices that five or six relatives are taking unofficial pictures at weddings and making it harder for you to get good shots.
* You don’t have to be Steven Spielberg to know that some new blockbuster, or string of blockbusters, is going to give a significant boost to the earnings of Paramount or Orion Pictures.
You could be an actor, an extra, a director, a stuntman, a lawyer, a gaffer, the makeup person, or the usher at a local cinema, where the standing-room-only crowds six weeks in a row inspire you to investigate the pros and cons of investing in Orion’s stock.

### I’ve Got It, I’ve Got It—What Is It?

#### BIG COMPANIES, SMALL MOVES
The size of a company has a great deal to do with what you can expect to get out of the stock. How big is this company in which you’ve taken an interest? Specific products aside, big companies don’t have big stock moves. In certain markets they perform well, but you’ll get your biggest moves in smaller companies. You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years. If you buy Coca-Cola at the right price, you might triple your money in six years, but you’re not going to hit the jackpot in two.

GE has 900 million shares outstanding, and a total market value of $39 billion.
The annual profit, more than $3 billion, is enough to qualify as a Fortune 500 company on its own. There is simply no way that GE could accelerate its growth very much without taking over the world. And since fast growth propels stock prices, it’s no surprise that GE moves slowly.

#### THE SIX CATEGORIES
six categories cover all of the useful distinctions that any investor has to make.
1. Slow growers
    * Large and aging companies are expected to grow slightly faster than the GDP.
    Slow growers didn’t start out that way. They started out as fast growers and eventually pooped out, either because they had gone as far as they could, or else they got too tired to make the most of their chances.
    * When an industry at large slows down (as they always seem to do), most of the companies within the industry lose momentum as well. Sooner or later every popular fast-growing industry becomes a slow-growing industry, and numerous analysts and prognosticators are fooled.
    * Cars became the fast-growth industry, and for a time it was steel, then chemicals, then electric utilities, then computers.

2. Stalwarts
    * Stalwarts are (Coca-Cola, P&G, Colgate-Palmolive) multibillion-dollar hulks, not exactly agile climbers, but they’re faster than slow growers.
    * 10 to 12 percent annual growth in earnings.
    * If a stalwart gone up 50 percent in a year or two, you have to wonder if maybe that’s enough and begin to think about selling.
    * They offer pretty good protection during recessions and hard times. You know they won’t go bankrupt, and soon enough they will be reassessed and their value will be restored.

3. Fast growers
    * Small, aggressive new enterprises that grow at 20 to 25 percent a year. If you choose wisely, this is the land of the 10-to 40-baggers, and even the 200-baggers..
    * There’s plenty of risk in fast growers, especially in the younger companies that tend to be overzealous and underfinanced.
    * Look for the ones that have good balance sheets and are making substantial profits. The trick is figuring out when they’ll stop growing, and how much to pay for the growth.

4. Cyclicals
    * The autos, airlines, tire, steel, defense and chemical companies are all cyclicals.
    * Coming out of a recession and into a vigorous economy, the cyclicals flourish, and their stock prices tend to rise much faster than the prices of the stalwarts. This is understandable, since people buy new cars and take more airplane trips in a vigorous economy, and there’s greater demand for steel, chemicals, etc. But going the other direction, the cyclicals suffer, and so do the pocketbooks of the shareholders. You can lose more than fifty percent of your investment very quickly if you buy cyclicals in the wrong part of the cycle, and it may be years before you’ll see another upswing.
    * If a stalwart (Bristol-Myers) can lose half its value in a sorry market and/or a national economic slump, a cyclical (Ford) can lose 80 percent. You have to know that owning Ford is different from owning Bristol-Myers.
