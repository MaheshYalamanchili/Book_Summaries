## Summary:
#### 1. Less is more:
  - Cut away the fat from your portfolio and process.
  - Get rid of anything you don't understand or don't have a good reason for holding.
#### 2. Focus on what you can control:
  - Write down each step in your process and focus only on those areas that are within your control.
#### 3. The best investment process is the one you are willing and able to stick with through any market cycle:
  - Look back on some of the worst investment decisions you've made. And figure out how to structure your process so you never make the same mistakes again in the future.
#### 4. Emotional intelligence and an understanding of behavioral biases are much more important than the level of your IQ:
  - From your list of mistakes from above, figure out which behavioral biases contributed to each.
  - Next, work on automating good decisions up front through a sound, systematic investment process.
#### 5. You're not the next Warren Buffet, but that's okay:
  - Look in the mirror. Do you see Warren Buffett? If not, don't try for the same type of performance that Buffett has earned over the years.
  - Instead, take his long-term outlook to heart and focus on improving your emotional intelligence.
#### 6. Stock picking is sexier, but asset allocation is much more important for your overall performance and risk tolerance:
  - Try to match your current asset allocation between stocks, bonds, cash and other assets, with your risk profile and time horizon.
#### 7. Get rich patiently and never be in a hurry:
  - Figure out what "long-term" means for you and your specific goals. Determine the particular time horizon for each goal and keep that in mind when making investment decisions.
#### 8. You cannot expect to make money in the stock market without losing money on occasion:
  - Before the next market crash (not after) determine how much you can stand to lose both financially and psychologically.
  - Never have more money in stocks than you can stand to lose. It will only lead to poor decisions at the wrong time.
#### 9. Simplicity, discipline, patience, and a focus on the long-run are generally lacking in the financial industry:
  - Create an investment plan in writing, that covers all of your goals and desires and force yourself to think and act for the long-term by avoiding short-term behavior.
#### 10. Wealth means nothing if there's no meaning attached to it:
  - Donating even small amounts puts people in a better mood. Figure out how your money can make you happier and find ways to enjoy it.
