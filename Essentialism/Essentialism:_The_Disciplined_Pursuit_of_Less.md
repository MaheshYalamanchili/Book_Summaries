**Nonessentilaism** is applying energy in all direction and hence making small progress in all direction. This will give us  the unfulfilling experience of making a millimeter of progress in a million directions.</br>
**Essentialism** is investing in fewer things we have to get the satisfying experience of making significant progress in the things that matter most.

It is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.

|Does	| **THE UNDISCIPLINED PURSUIT OF MORE**</br>Reacts to what’s most pressing</br>Says “yes” to people without really thinking</br>Tries to force execution at the last moment| **THE DISCIPLINED PURSUIT OF LESS**</br>Pauses to discern what really matters</br>Says “no” to everything except the essential</br>Removes obstacles to make execution easy|
|Gets| **LIVES A LIFE THAT DOES NOT SATISFY**</br>Takes on too much, and work suffers</br>Feels out of control</br>Is unsure of whether the right things got done</br>Feels overwhelmed and exhausted| **LIVES A LIFE THAT REALLY MATTERS**</br>Chooses carefully in order to do great work</br>Feels in control</br>Gets the right things done Experiences joy in the journey|
