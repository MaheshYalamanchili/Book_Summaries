# Section 1 - AVOID BIG RISKS
## How not to invest
* When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.
* Which of the following investment strategies should you use:
  1. Making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities and, as a result, living with some failed investments, or
  2. Being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments?
* Minimize the risk of committing type I errors to curtail the risk of injury or death, and learn to live with type II errors or foregone benefits.
  * Tesla and Eicher Motors are the kinds of type II error we will inevitably commit because we reject highly indebted businesses, rapidly evolving industry landscapes, and turnarounds.
  * We can be better investors only if we are better “rejectors.” 
* The path to creating wealth in rapidly evolving industries is treacherous, and we refuse to walk on it.
* We like industries in which the winners and losers have been largely sorted out and the rules of the game are apparent to everyone.
* We don’t invest in businesses run by crooks, we detest turnarounds, we stay as far away from leverage as possible, we refuse to engage with M&A addicts, we can’t figure out fast-changing industries, and we don’t align ourselves with unaligned owners.
### M&A Failures Reasons
* Culture mismatch, overpayment, misevaluation of the opportunity, external factors, and integration problems, among many others
   
# Section 2 - BUY HIGH QUALITY AT A FAIR PRICE
## Select a single business trait that brings with it many favorable business qualities.
* An economic franchise arises from a product or service that (1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have no close substitute; and (3) is not subject to price regulation. The existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a company’s ability to regularly price its product or service aggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital. Moreover, franchises can tolerate mismanagement. Inept managers may diminish a franchise’s profitability, but they cannot inflict mortal damage.  - Warren Buffett
* Dont prefer ROE since it is calculated after taxes and interest payments, and hence mixes operating performance with financing strategy and tax structure
* A Consistently High-ROCE Business
  * Is Likely to Be Run by an Excellent Management Team
  * Is Likely to Have a Strong Competitive Advantage - brand, intellectual property, network effect, economies of scale, and low cost.
  * Allocates Capital Well
  * Allows Companies to Take Business Risk Without Taking Financial Risk, Which Increases the Chance of Business Success
  * A high ROCE with modest revenue growth will generate excess cash.
* Exceptions for ROCE as first filter:
  1. A consistently high ROCE in the past does not guarantee that ROCE will be high in the future.
     * if a business has a monopoly in its industry, even a poor-quality management team would probably be able to earn a decent return on capital
     * if there is high tariff protection for a product or commodity domestic companies manufacturing the same product or commodity may earn decent profits without breaking a sweat
     * if its key competitors get in trouble of their own making, the company can earn decent return on capital
  2. We may miss companies that may become hugely successful in the future.
## owning only robust businesses that are resilient to internal and external shocks while continuing to evolve and grow
* What we seek as owners in our businesses: the ability to keep evolving while staying robust
* If a company’s growth is lower than its ROCE, it will also keep generating free cash flow
* In general, highly robust businesses evolve by taking calculated risks. But sometimes, very rarely, businesses can succeed by taking huge risks, as shown by Netflix.
* seek robustness in companies as the best available benchmark to assess if they are likely to adapt and survive over the long term
* Problems with robustness:
  1. business can lose its robustness
  2. too much robustness - unable or unwilling to implement any neutral strategies to expand its customer base, product segments, or geographies, and results in poor sales growth
* The Only Way to Protect Against Loss of Robustness Is Entry Valuation
## Ignore proximate causes of stock price movements while focusing on ultimate explanations of business success
* Properties of hot themes:
  1. **hypes up total addressable market (TAM)** - TAM is pointless because it does not tell us whether any profits will be made, and even if a business can be profitable, TAM is silent on who will make that moolah.
  2. is simple to understand
  3. is actionable
* Differentiate between proximate and ultimate causes
  * Proximate causes of share price changes can result from the macroeconomy, the markets, the industry, or the company itself. Since proximate causes are highly salient (e.g., the Fed announcing an interest rate cut or a company announcing a slowing of sales growth), investors may erroneously overweight them in their decision-making process.
  * Ignore all proximate causes when analyzing businesses
  * When proximate causes get divorced from ultimate ones, markets can offer even great businesses at a fair price.
## Studying and understanding the history of a business and an industry instead of constantly obsessing over the future
* **Templete for automotive componant company**: First, the parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring proprietary technology and have a low customer concentration over many years. It should have only one or two competitors, and the competitive dynamics in the industry should be stable over the long term. Finally, there should have been no new entrants to the industry for many years, and the company should have delivered good financials historically. Note that not a single criterion here is about the future.
* a company has had a historical ROCE over the past decade of 40 percent:
  * There can be two opinions, the company has a great future or microeconomic theory demands that these returns will be competed away
  * **Focus on the sources of these returns and their sustainability** : did the company earn these returns because of regulatory protection from overseas competition, and, if so, are we comfortable backing a business that has not faced genuine competition? Or were these returns earned despite fierce competition? What has the company done relative to the competition that has made it so unique?
## internalizing the recurring patterns of success and failure in the business world
  * We detest the phrases “This time, it’s different” and “My gut tells me this will work.” We need to see the evidence that our investment thesis has worked elsewhere.
  * The business world is convergent. There are definitive patterns to the success and failure of companies. We exploit this property of the corporate world to select outstanding businesses and reject lousy ones by asking a simple question: “Where else have we seen this?”
  * We are investors not in individual businesses but in proven and successful templates of businesses.
  * However, applying the principle of convergence is tricky because we humans can see patterns where none exist. We can also miss out on one-off opportunities like Amazon that seem to defy the convergent notion that focus is the key to success
## differentiate between the honest and dishonest signals of businesses
* Any signal that management gives during a meeting is a cheap signal requiring minimal effort. And since it is cheap, the signal may be dishonest even if the management is not
* We ignore - press releases, management meetings and interviews, investor conferences, and earnings guidance since all these signals attempt to favorably impress investors and are generally quite easy to produce
* Rely exclusively on honest signals from businesses that are costly to produce - past operating and financial performance and scuttlebutt signals from suppliers, customers, competitors, ex-employees, and industry experts
# Section 3 - DON’T BE LAZY - BE VERY LAZY
* High-quality businesses, seem to undergo many changes when measured over days or weeks or months but are much more stable when the period of measurement is years or decades.
* Grant–Kurtén principle of investing (GKPI). GKPI says: When we find high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term, we should exploit the inevitable short-term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling
* Great businesses generally remain great, and bad businesses generally remain bad.
