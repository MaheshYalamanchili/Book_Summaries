## The Business of Investing
* An investor has to be lazy in taking profits and agile in cutting losses.
* To attain financial freedom an investor must strive to have at least a corpus of fifty times his annual expense.

## Magic of Compounding
* There are not too many instances in an investor’s life where he would be right with his investments so when he is the attempt should be to try and make the maximum out of it.
* If the risks are higher then no matter how big the rewards are he should sit back and introspect. Allocating small amounts will make negligible difference to the portfolio and by buying more he might put the good work of the previous years at risk.

## The Pain of Losing
* It is much better to buy a stock after it has started to show improved earnings than on its anticipation of doing that.
* While stealing ideas is easy, borrowing conviction isn’t and works only as long as the trade moves in a favourable direction.

## Buy What You See
* A company with negative cash from operations is more likely to see a trend break than one which has a positive cash from operations.

## Intrinsic Value
* The primary driver of price is earnings but the secondary and almost equally powerful driver of prices are the perception of those earnings.

## Identifying Tops and Bottom
* Prices fail to hold at the top by more than a few hours. In most cases the top is made on intraday prices where the stock sees a sharp correction towards the close after having fallen vertically from its intra day high
* An investor gets enough time to buy at the bottom while he gets almost no time to sell at the top.
* Formation of tops - the price moves in swift strokes and then hits a peak to retrace back sharply within a day or two, 
* Formation of bottom is relatively slow as prices consolidate at a point for days, weeks and even months before making an upmove.
* A new trend never develops in sectors that have participated in the previous bull run.

## Understanding business model
* Purchasing on credit indicates that there is plenty of competition amongst the suppliers while selling on cash means that the buyers are weak and dispersed. Both these attributes shifts the bargaining power of the business to the company.
* A good business will necessarily generate a high Return on Equity (RoE) without employing too much debt and follow an asset light model where investments in fixed assets like plant and machinery is relatively low even while the working capital remains negative

## Financial Ratios
### Enterprise Value
* During bear markets a serious investor is able to locate several companies trading either at a zero or negative enterprise value. Such opportunities arise for companies whose cash on balance sheet is more than the market cap. Piramal Enterprises in 2010 and Trent in 2002 are two such examples of a stock available at negative enterprise value.

### RoE Du Pont Analysis
* A company that increases its RoE by excessive use of leverage isn’t as good, as a company that generates a high RoE with minimum use of leverage.
* Generally, the RoE in its decomposed form, growth rate and dividend payout provides the maximum amount of information on how a company is slated to perform over longer periods of time.

## On Management
* A great management in a great business is a wonderful combination
* With good managements running bad e.g. some commodity cyclical businesses. Here the contribution of the management to deliver above average shareholder returns remains limited.
* A bad management in a great business will not be able to generate any substantial benefit for its shareholders but will find it extremely hard to cause any long term damage to the business whereas a bad management would take only a couple of years to destroy a bad business.
* Promoters who issue warrants to themselves at a large discount to the market price are also not considered as being fair to the minority shareholders.

## On Dividend
* A company whose stock goes up on dividends is more prone to retaining its increase in market cap than a company whose stock price rises from increase in earnings alone without a corresponding increase in dividend payout.

## Operating Leverage
* Higher the disparity between a high gross margin and a low net margin, more the likelihood of a margin expansion
* A simple rule of thumb is to be on the lookout for a gross to net margin ratio of 6 times.
* It's' difficult to predict a margin expansion, a stock with rising revenues, increasing margins and an expanding P/E is potentially a big multibagger which does not come too often but when it does all an investor should do is to pull the trigger and fire rather than debate too much on the purchase price.

## Stocks to avoid
* A company from a sector which was at the forefront of the immediately preceding bull run.
* A cheap second line stock from a sector that is in a big bull run is also an avoid, more so when the sector has started to get hot from being warm earlier.
* A micro cap which hasn’t proved its business model is another type of company to ignore.
* Unless an investor is very sure about the prospects of a company, any stock which starts making 52 week lows for the first time is an avoid.
* The excessively large market cap of a stock in relation to its sector can also make a case for avoiding the stock.
* Another type of company to avoid is the one which makes a lot of acquisitions.
* A fast growing, low RoE, low entry barrier business, with negative cash flows. Such an entity funds its growth either by raising debt or through repeated equity dilutions.
* The company grows its debt at a rate faster than or almost equal to the growth in revenues over a three to five year period then it is a case of potential financial distress.
* Another stock to avoid is a cyclical stock after it has had a string of good results.
* Another set of companies to avoid are companies with wide institutional coverage and priced for perfection.
* The management of a company which does too many conference calls, analyst meets and investor presentations should be avoided.

## PE Expansion and Contraction
* Earnings of capital goods companies react to economic slowdown with a lag because the company kept reporting increased earnings as its past order book got executed over a period of time even as new order flows slowed down.

## Smallcap & Midcap Stocks
* The screening process applicable to most companies and specifically to smaller sized businesses range from scalability in the business model, secular growth, high RoE, sector leadership, management focus, cash flow generation, earnings predictability, reasonable debt and a stated dividend payout policy with growing yield.
* A company growing revenues and profits through frequent debt and equity dilutions; having a RoE less than the desired rate of growth and generating negative operating cash flows with a low payout ratio is a potential case for business failure.
* A company that grows at more than its RoE faces growth challenges and gets over this issue by repeated equity and debt offerings both of which are easier to do in a bull market.
* Ensure that the growth in debt is less than the growth in revenues and the debt equity ratio displays a stable to declining trend.
* The company generates a positive operating cash flow; however companies that have a negative operating cash flow also do well in a fierce bull market.
* The dividend yield is 1.5% to 2% of the current price while an illiquid stock without yield is a potential case for catastrophe.

## The one I saw & Missed
* Talking about a stock that an investor saw but did not buy makes no difference to an investor’s balance sheet and should therefore not be a part of his thinking process except to draw any learnings out of it.

## When to Sell
* One of the most important reasons for selling a stock is because
  1. the investor has found a new opportunity better than the one he actually holds
  2. extended valuations
  3. a bull market sector losing favour
  4. change in the original thesis either due to management action or an adverse government regulation
  5. advent of a new competitor
  6. general business slowdown
  7. increasing portfolio skewness due to movement in the price of a specific stock.
* The weaker companies generally outperform the stronger ones on the way up while the stronger ones do better than the weaker ones - on the way down.
* Selling stocks just because they are expensive and have got ahead of current earnings should be avoided by long term investors especially if the company is small with respect to the total size of opportunity and the business in question is poised for years of above average growth.
### Cyclicals
* High quality cyclical could be bought at around 50% to 60% fall from its all time high whereas a low quality cyclical can be purchased at a 70% fall from the top.
* A high quality cyclical like Tata Steel will move up three to four times from the bottom to the top whereas the low quality ones move up four to six times.

## Companies with Cash on balance Sheet
* Markets do not like companies who hold (hoard) cash because held on its own, cash will be unable to match the returns from the operating side of the business.
* While investing in companies with cash on balance sheet does protect the downside, the prospect of an immediate upside in such stocks is generally limited, unless there is a strong catalyst waiting to unlock the cash value for the minority shareholders

## Banks & NBFCs
* An asset book which has gone up in the last one year is looked at with more suspicion than an asset book which has increased evenly over a longer period
* A book value made up of capital raised by QIPs and private placements will be valued less generously than a book created exclusively out of retained earnings.
* A bank that dilutes equity at a high price to book is an instant rerating candidate.
* PSU banks diluting equity at nearer to their book value see negligible impact on the book and hence those stocks do not move that much either.
* The cost to income ratio indicates the level of operating cost for each rupee of income. Generally, a ratio of less than 45% is considered adequate for generating efficiencies of scale.
* The RoE is the true indicator of capital efficiency an investor should value these banks in relation to the RoE that the business generates.
* A bank or a NBFC generating a 35% RoE could trade at 6.25 times (35 / 5.6) price to book where 5.6 is pretax fd rate

## Holding Companies
* A holding company whose subsidiaries pay a lot of dividends will always be valued at a lesser discount than a company whose subsidiaries do not pay too much dividend,

## Secular Growth Companies
* While using growth to decipher the P/E for valuing these companies, one should also stress on the dividend yield as companies with a high payout get their valuation on the basis of the yield also.

## Portfolio Constuction
* Having the right portfolio weights is more important than picking up the right stocks.
* Prefer to move out at the first stroke of trouble even if it comes with the cost of losing the potential upside
* While computing the size of the portfolio and the resultant weight for each of the stocks, an investor should completely Ignore his original investment and decide the future course of action based on current market price only.
* Investor should ask himself whether an investment idea that he owns or is planning to own can sell at a price 50% lower to the current price 3 years down the line. So even if a stock is expensive an investor will get an immediate answer on this based on the management, business model, growth profile and past operating history.
* It is better to be a little late for a good party than be early for a bad one.
* A diversified risk averse portfolio should however have a certain set of checks and balances which may include:
* Buy a good business at the market price rather than a bad one at a discount.
* The best stock to own could, in most times, be the stock that an investor already owns.
