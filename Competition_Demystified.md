# 1. Strategy, Markets, And Competition
## Strategy vs Tactics:  
* Decision to enter a market is Strategy. Once entered, success depends on skillful implementation  
  * efficient performance  
  * marketing campaign  
  * appropriate investment  
  * design & engineering time  
  * management attention to continuous improvement
* If size of the market is huge, no company need to think about actions of its competition and success depends on skillful implementation.
* Strategic choices are outward looking. Strategic choice involves two issues:
  * Selecting the arena of competition, the market in which to engage
    * e.g., IBM in PC markets outsourced OS to Microsoft and Processors to Intel
  * Management of those external agents
    * Even with world class disciplines, no one can predict with absolute certainty, how other companies CEO will respond to your latest move. Yet Management need to device a strategy by taking that response into account.
