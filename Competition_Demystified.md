# 1. Strategy, Markets, And Competition
## Strategy vs Tactics:  
* Decision to enter a market is Strategy. Once entered, success depends on skillful implementation  
  * Efficient performance  
  * Marketing campaign  
  * Appropriate investment  
  * Design & engineering time  
  * Management attention to continuous improvement
* If size of the market is huge, no company need to think about actions of its competition and success depends on skillful implementation.
* Strategic choices are outward looking. Strategic choice involves two issues:
  * Selecting the arena of competition, the market in which to engage
    * e.g., IBM in PC markets outsourced OS to Microsoft and Processors to Intel
  * Management of those external agents
    * Even with world class disciplines, no one can predict with absolute certainty, how other companies CEO will respond to your latest move. Yet Management need to device a strategy by taking that response into account.
## On the Porter's Five Forces:
* Among five forces _**Potential of new entrants (Barriers to entry) is much more important than others.**_
  1. Competition in the industry
  2. _**Potential of new entrants into the industry**_
  3. Power of suppliers
  4. Power of customers
  5. Threat of substitute products
  
* Operational effectiveness is only strategy appropriate in markets without barriers to entry.
